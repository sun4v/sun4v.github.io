2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:

   	Several properties added to nodes in the PRI to support SDIO.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

    	 The property "assignable-path" is added to component nodes to provide
	 the exact physical path of the assignable component. This path may
	 differ from the "path" property in the same node, due to differences
	 between information needed for FMA vs information needed for the LDOMS
	 manager.

	 The property "rcid" is added to root-complex nodes to provide a unique
	 identifier for each root complex.

	 The property directio_capability is added to the firmware node to
	 indicate that this platform and firmware are capable of supporting
	 PCI-E virtualization.
