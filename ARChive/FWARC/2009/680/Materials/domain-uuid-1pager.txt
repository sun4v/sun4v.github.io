2. Project Summary

  2.1. Project Description:

	This case is an extension of FWARC/2005/633 "LDoms: Project
	Q Logical Domaining Umbrella (sun4v/hypervisor/LDoms)"
	that is required to support identifying each logical
        domain with its own Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
        This is described in RFE 6873151.

	This case describes a new property to the machine
        description (MD) data for Logical Domains (LDoms).
        It proposes that the property "uuid" be added to the
        "platform" MD node.
