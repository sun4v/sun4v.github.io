2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
        Implement a new optional Machine Description CPU node property
        to advertise RA bits supported by MMU.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
        RA limit for a domain should be calculated dynamically based on
        a MD property.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        LDoms engineering.

   3.3. Business Justification:
        Sun4v Memory DR support.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        The project will be done when the property is implemented
        according to specification and used by Solaris for sun4v
        memory DR support.

4. Technical Description:

   4.1 Overview

       Currently, Solaris sun4v calculates RA limit -- the highest RA
       value for a domain -- based on the highest mblock RA value in
       the MD.  The Kernel Physical Map (KPM) VA space is then sized
       and allocated based on the RA limit value.

       This is fine for a static configuration but does not work for
       memory DR since RA limit should be set to the highest theoretical
       value rather the highest boot value.  Memory DR also sizes and
       allocates a DR VA map based on the RA limit value which it then
       uses to map in/out page_t's for incoming/outgoing memory.

       Sun4u platforms size KPM from constant max values set in platform-
       specific code.  Sun4v platforms will use the "mmu-#ra-bits" MD
       property to pass in the #ra bits and calculcate RA limit accordingly.

   4.1.1 CPU node

       The following optional property will be added to the CPU node.

       Property:

       Name          Tag       Req'd?  Description
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       mmu-#ra-bits  PROP_VAL  No      A 64-bit unsigned integer giving
                                       the number of real address bits
                                       supported by this virtual CPU. If
                                       not present, no default value is
                                       assumed and the max RA value can
                                       be inferred from the 'mblock'
                                       nodes.
