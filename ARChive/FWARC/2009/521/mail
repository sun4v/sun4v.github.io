I'm sponsoring this fast track case for Wentao Yang.  It defines a new  
guest MD property for vsw & vnet: 'maxbw'.  This will be used to  
establish bandwidth limits on specified plumbed vsw & vnet devices.   
The 1-pager & an updated VIO MD Specification excerpt are available in  
the case materials:

http://sac.eng/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2009/521/materials/

Requested binding is for a minor/micro firmware release and minor/ 
micro/patch OS release.

This case times out on 10/5/09.

Thanks.

-Eric

(Cc'ing a few folks from the Crossbow architecture team, and PSARC ofr a possible cross-ARCs deliverables)

What kind of interaction is there between the 'maxbw' MD property on the LDOM
side, and the Solaris link property, also called 'maxbw' and settable through dladm set-linkprop -p maxbw=<val> ?
What are the cases where a sys admin should opt fpr using the former vs the latter?
any meaning to have both props set at the same time?



  2.1. Project Description:

	This case adds a new property, named 'maxbw', to the Machine
	Description (MD) nodes 'virtual-device' and 'virtual-device-port'.
	These properties are relevant for vsw (i.e. 'virtual-network-switch')
	and vnet (i.e. 'virtual-network-port') devices only.  The 'maxbw'
	property specifies a maximum bandwidth limit for the corresponding
	virtual switch (for use when plumbed as a network interface) or virtual
	network device.

When a sys admin wants to enforce a bandwidth limit on a vsw or vnet in 
LDoms environment,
(s)he will configure it via LDoms CLI. That is, the 'maxbw' MD property 
will be only used through
LDoms CLI for vsw/vnet.

There are no meaning to have both props set at the same time, there is 
no effect
to use 'dladm set-linkprop -p maxbw=<val>' to set maxbw on vsw/vnet. The sys
admin needs to use LDoms CLIs to enforce bandwidth limit on vsw/vnet, i.e.,

    ldm set-vsw maxbw=20M vsw0

This will set 20M bandwidth limit on vsw0.

There are no meaning to have both props set at the same time, there is 
no effect
to use 'dladm set-linkprop -p maxbw=<val>' to set maxbw on vsw/vnet. The sys
admin needs to use LDoms CLIs to enforce bandwidth limit on vsw/vnet, i.e.,

    ldm set-vsw maxbw=20M vsw0

This will set 20M bandwidth limit on vsw0.

So, let's look at the whole architecture here:
vsw0 is a MAC client. It holds a mac client handle that it uses later to 
set a MAC address, then send 'n receive data
through the MAC layer.
The MAC layer, since Crossbow, is now the point of enforcement of
resource controls, including bandwidth limits, priorities, CPUs, etc.
Today, we can express those resource controls on all datalink clients 
(those listed by dladm show-link).
However, the vsw MAC client is an internal only client, and doesn't show 
up in dladm show-link
so  we can't call dladm set-linkprop -p maxbw=<val> vsw0 for example.

Will you be extending the MAC client API to allow it to expose a 
function that takes any client name
as argument for the property setting functions (thus having the maxbw 
for vsw0) ?
I am not clear on how and where the support for the maxbw vsw settable 
is built.

Vsw has serves two things:

1) as a virtual switch for all vnet devices. In Nevada, we use Crossbow
switching functionality, that is, vsw opens a mac-client for each 
corresponding
vnet. This is the main functionality for vsw.

2) Vsw also provides a network device functionality, it is to provide 
the ability
     to communicate with Guest domains. To provide this, vswitch also opens
     a mac-client that meant to receive the traffic for its own device.

Yes,.

I don't believe, this is the case.  For dladm, vsw looks like a Gldv3 
NIC driver,
so it can apply all things that it can on a typical NIC drivers(there 
are a few
limitations such as mac-address change and vnics won't work on top of vsw).

The reason for us to define an MD property is to allow an management 
entiry(LDoms
manager) running on a different domain(control domain) to be able to 
set/configure
various properties for all virtual devices.  We are not planning to 
extend any additional
ability to modify this from the OS management point of view, but it may 
be good
to provide the ability to show the internal mac-clients. We probably 
need to discuss
the visibility part in LDoms/Crossbow discussions, see what more we can 
do there.

Note, LDoms domains are managed by LDoms manager which typically running
in a different domain(Control domain) and has various CLIs to manage 
virtual devices.
For example, if one has to set a limit for a particular vnet device, he 
would run the
following command:

ldm set-vnet maxbw=20M vnet0

This would cause an MD update that is notified to 'vsw' driver on a 
Service Domain,
which will enforce that limit in whatever the implementation thats 
specific to the
OS thats running on the Service domain. We have discussed so far about 
the implementation
details on Nevada.  Please note, this FWARC is focused on the method to 
inform the
LDoms virtual switch about a specific configuration parameter for a 
virtual network device.

Hope this clarifies your question,

Vsw has serves two things:

1) as a virtual switch for all vnet devices. In Nevada, we use Crossbow
switching functionality, that is, vsw opens a mac-client for each 
corresponding
vnet. This is the main functionality for vsw.

2) Vsw also provides a network device functionality, it is to provide 
the ability
     to communicate with Guest domains. To provide this, vswitch also opens
     a mac-client that meant to receive the traffic for its own device.

I don't believe, this is the case.  For dladm, vsw looks like a Gldv3 
NIC driver,
so it can apply all things that it can on a typical NIC drivers(there 
are a few
limitations such as mac-address change and vnics won't work on top of vsw).

The reason for us to define an MD property is to allow an management 
entiry(LDoms
manager) running on a different domain(control domain) to be able to 
set/configure
various properties for all virtual devices.  We are not planning to 
extend any additional
ability to modify this from the OS management point of view, but it may 
be good
to provide the ability to show the internal mac-clients. We probably 
need to discuss
the visibility part in LDoms/Crossbow discussions, see what more we can 
do there.

Note, LDoms domains are managed by LDoms manager which typically running
in a different domain(Control domain) and has various CLIs to manage 
virtual devices.
For example, if one has to set a limit for a particular vnet device, he 
would run the
following command:

ldm set-vnet maxbw=20M vnet0

This would cause an MD update that is notified to 'vsw' driver on a 
Service Domain,
which will enforce that limit in whatever the implementation thats 
specific to the
OS thats running on the Service domain. We have discussed so far about 
the implementation
details on Nevada.  Please note, this FWARC is focused on the method to 
inform the
LDoms virtual switch about a specific configuration parameter for a 
virtual network device.

Hope this clarifies your question,

Thanks. This clarifies what you're delivering to the sysfw consolidation.

However, your case also lists ON as a second target consolidation.
What changes is the case delivering there?

Reading the value of 'maxbw' property from the MD node (for the mac 
client) and programming it in the mac using the mac client API, is done 
by the vsw driver in Solaris.

I hope, I didn't mean to say that there are no changes being delivered to ON
consolidation. We will be delivering a change to vsw driver
to consume this property and set the right resource control via the 
currently
published MAC client API.  Y'day, Wentao published a webrev to Nicolas
to review from Crossbow perspective, if you  would like to be involved
in Nevada related changes to vsw, please let us know.

Wentao sent me the webrev yesterday and the use of the MAC client API to 
set the bandwidth limit is appropriate.

For completeness the case material could include the private interfaces 
that are imported here (mac_client_set_resources(), MRP_MAXBW_MINVAL, 
MRP_MAXBW, MRP_MAXBW_RESETVAL, and the sys/mac_flow.h header file.)

I understand it is rather rare to have cross ARCs discussions, but I 
believe PSARC should've been Cc'ed for cases importing interfaces it
reviewed very recently.

For the purpose of the ARC review, the MAC Client API exported by 
PSARC/2006/357 should be listed
as an imported interface for this FWARC case. It took a few email 
exchanges to figure out what the case is actually
delivering in ON, then what interfaces it is importing there. As 
originally filed, reading it literally, it felt like the case is 
delivering a
redundant functionality.

The case should also state the release binding for the ON changes. Given 
the dependency on PSARC/2006/357's,
the changes may not be delivered as a patch. That needs to be explicitly 
mentioned.

I believe an updated spec is needed here.

A normal case dependency should take care of that.  There doesn't seem
to be any incompatible change introduced by this case, and thus no
reason for the case to seek a release binding other than Patch.  The
case simply wouldn't be able to be delivered in a Patch unless its case
dependencies were also delivered.
