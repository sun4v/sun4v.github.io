2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

	This case adds a new property, named 'maxbw', to the Machine
	Description (MD) nodes 'virtual-device' and 'virtual-device-port'.
	These properties are relevant for vsw (i.e. 'virtual-network-switch')
	and vnet (i.e. 'virtual-network-port') devices only.  The 'maxbw'
	property specifies a maximum bandwidth limit for the corresponding
	virtual switch (for use when plumbed as a network interface) or virtual
	network device.

	The vsw driver will be modified to use the Crossbow APIs listed below
	(section 4.2) to provide bandwidth resource control functionality
	for virtual network devices.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

	The bandwidth limits specified here require operating system changes
	for them to be enforced.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

   	This is a feature commonly requested by customers for enforcing QOS
	on LDoms virtual network infrastructure.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        
	SPARC CMT Platforms, to satisfy requirement for QOS controls.

   3.3. Business Justification:
        

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        LDoms Manager software & Solaris software.

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:

        When bandwidth limits set by an LDoms administrator are enforced by the
        system.

4. Technical Description:

   4.1 Overview

	See updated LDoms VIO MD Specification excerpt included with the case
	materials.
