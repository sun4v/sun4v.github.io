        Deprecated 'cfg-handle' property to node components where
          "topo-hc-name=pciexrc"
        Corrected a few minor typos.
+ 1.8   Added additional constraints on the 'id' property in the root complex
+       component node, clarified the definition of root complex vs. root
+       port component nodes, and removed incorrect wording in the description
+       of the 'cfg-handle' and 'path' properties in the 'iodevice' node.

! Any type of node may have an id property. The id property must be unique within
! a set of nodes with the same topo-hc-name value as well as immutable across
! system reset events. In addition, for root complex IO nodes (i.e. nodes whose
! topo-hc-name value is "hostbridge"), the id property is further constrained to
! have whatever platform-specific binding is required for this value to denote a
! unique and persistent root complex ID. This property is required for nodes that
! do *not* set the topo-skip property. Grandfather clause: 'id' is *always*
! required for strand, mem-board, and cpu-board nodes.

  Any type of node may set the topo-skip property.
  
! Nodes representing a root complex must use a topo-hc-name of "pciexrc" and
  set the path property. Previous requirements for setting the cfg-handle
  property for a node representing a root complex is now deprecated.
  
  Any type node that is a FRU (fru = 0x1) are required to include the
  serial_number, part_number, rev_number, and dash_number properties.

  This property contains the canonical path of an io device, composed of its
  full device path with device names removed. It is required on nodes where

  beginning with its parent and continuing through its ancestry until reaching
