2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

	This case provides additional constraints around the definition of
	the "id" property in the hostbridge component node (i.e. the node whose 
	"topo-hc-name" property is "hostbridge") as defined in FWARC/2008/300.

	In addition, this case removes discrepancies between the specification
	of the "hostbridge" and "pciexrc" topo-hc-name values and their actual
	use.  Finally, inappropriate comments regarding cases in which the
	'cfg-handle' and 'path' properties in the 'iodevice' node are not
	required have been removed.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

	It is assumed the new rules for the "id" property as defined in this
	case will be in force for all PRIs conforming to FWARC/2008/300.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

   	Software needs to be able to interpret & intelligently act upon the PRI
	as it is enhanced & updated.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Supernova/RF platforms, to provide the necessary infrastructure to
	allow the LDom Manager to produce proper "rcid" property values to
	Hypervisor.  Also, the specification needs to match the actual
	implementation.

   3.3. Business Justification:
        

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Supernova Firmware.

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into the vBSC gates.

4. Technical Description:

   See updated PRI specification and diffs files including with the case
   materials.
