2. Project Summary

2.1 Project Description

	This project adds a new agent to the Logical Domains Agents framework,
	as defined in FWARC 2009/426.

	The "direct I/O" agent provides information about all PCI-E devices of
	a particular guest to the control domain.

2.2 Risks and Assumptions

	None.

3. Business Summary

3.1 Problem Area

    	The static direct I/O project requires the Logical Domains Manager to
	know about all available PCI-E devies in a particular guest domain.
	Contrary to other system information gathered by the LDoms Manager, the
	detailed PCI-E device information is not available in the PRI.
	Instead, we need an entity within the guest itself to probe its
	environment and provide this information.  The Logical Domains Agents
	framework is designed for just this purpose.

3.2 Market/Requestor

	See FWARC 2005/633.

3.3 Business Justification

	See FWARC 2005/633.

3.4 Competitive Analysis

	The static direct I/O project is already funded & approved as a
	strategic feature need for Logical Domains.  Virtualization solutions
	provided by competitors provide similar functionality.

3.5 Opportunity Window/Exposure

	See FWARC 2005/663.

3.6 How will you know when you are done?

	The work will be completed when the final code changes to implement the
	LDoms "Direct I/O" agent is integrated into the Solaris Nevada gate and
	Solaris 10 Update gates.

4. Technical Description

4.1 Overview

	The Direct I/O Agent will be implemented as a virtual domain service as
	defined in FWARC 2008/563 (Virtual Domain Service MD nodes and
	misc. properties). As a virtual domain service, the agent will be
	identified by the domain service id shown below. This agent will be
	able to send and receive messages to and from the control domain using
	the virtual domain services framework.

	The project will deliver the Direct I/O agents identified as follows:

	Service Name 		Description
	------------		-----------
	agent-dio		Direct I/O Agent

	This agent defines its own message type, based on the common
	message structure.  The agent is described in the updated "Logical
	Domain Agents Specification" document, provided as part of this case.

4.2 Bug/RFE Number(s)

	6848789 Static Direct I/O support
	6848792 LDom manager support for Static Direct I/O

4.3 Scope

	Not Applicable.

4.4 Out of Scope

	Not Applicable.

4.5 Interfaces

	4.5.1 Interfaces

		The new interface is embodied in the format of the
		messages passed between the control domain and the
		different agents.

		For a detailed description of the interface see the
		Logical Domain Agents Specification document.
