SUNW,set-sun4v-version ( minor major group -- act-minor status )

    Requests a specific set of the hypervisor API services, as per
    the API_SET_VERSION call.  The input parameters are interpreted
    identically to the corresponding parameters to the hypervisor
    call.  The status and act-minor return values may be interpreted
    identically to the return values from the API_SET_VERSION call,
    except as noted below.

    OBP is expected to interpret its input parameters, and may
    return a status value of ENOTSUPPORTED or EINVAL if it cannot
    support the requested API group and major number parameters,
    even if the underlying sun4v implementation does support them.
    If OBP supports the requested API group and major number, it may
    negotiate a lower minor number than the minor number requested
    by the caller.


SUNW,get-sun4v-version ( group -- minor major status )

    Returns the current version of the given API group, as
    negotiated with the hypervisor via the SUNW,set-sun4v-version
    CIF call.  Return values are interpreted as for the
    API_GET_VERSION hypervisor call.
