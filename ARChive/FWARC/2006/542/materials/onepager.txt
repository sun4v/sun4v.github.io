2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:

	The soft state supported client interface function is used by client 
	programs to notify Openboot that the client program supports the Guest 
	State Feature described by FWARC 2006/473 [1].

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

	N/A

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

	The guest state is maintained by the current guest in a domain. While
	booting, Openboot transfers control of the domain to a new guest. When
	a guest that supports guest state has fully started the guest changes 
	the guest state from SIS_TRANSITIONAL to SIS_NORMAL. If the new guest 
	does not support guest state, i.e. a legacy version of Solaris, then 
	the guest will not be able to change the guest state from 
	SIS_TRANSITIONAL to SIS_NORMAL. When booting a guest which is unaware of 
	this interface, guest state aware Openboot is expected to set the guest 
	state to SIS_NORMAL when the guest takes the trap table.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
	
	N/A

   3.3. Business Justification:
	
	This CIF is needed to support legacy versions of Solaris and other 
	guests that do not support the guest state feature. To function 
	properly, guest state needs to be updated when a guest takes control
	of the trap table. Legacy versions of Solaris do not support the new Guest 
	State feature and cannot update the guest state after they have taken 
	control of the domain from Openboot. The SUNW,support-soft-state CIF 
	allows versions of guests that support guest state to differentiate 
	themselves from guests that do not support guest state.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:

	N/A

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

	Need for Huron RR

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
	
	The project will be completed when the interface is implemented and 
	tested on on n2 platforms and Openboot and Solaris code is integrated 
	in Openboot 4.x and ON gate respectively.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

	A new CIF is required to allow the guest to inform Openboot that it 
	supports the guest state mechanism. If the guest does not call into 
	Openboot with the soft state supported CIF, then Openboot assumes the 
	new guest does not support guest state. The guest needs to notify 
	Openboot with the CIF before the Openboot trap table is replaced with 
	the guest trap table.

	If Openboot assumes the new guest does not support guest state then it 
	will change the guest state from SIS_TRANSITIONAL to SIS_NORMAL when
	the guest requests control of the trap table. The CIF will be defined as:

	SUNW,soft-state-supported ( -- )

	The call has no arguments or return values.
