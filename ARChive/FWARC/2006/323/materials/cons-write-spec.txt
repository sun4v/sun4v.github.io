1 Introduction

  This document specifies a hypervisor API function to provide a
  multi-character console output interface to supplement the core
  console putchar interface.


2 cons-write API Call

  Entry:
	trap#		FAST_TRAP
	function#	CONS_WRITE
	arg0		raddr
	arg1		size

  Exit:
	ret0		status
	ret1		characters written

  Errors:
	ENORADDR	Invalid real address
	EWOULDBLOCK	Cannot complete operation without blocking
	EIO		I/O error

  Writes 'size' characters contained in the buffer
  indicated by the 'raddr' argument to the console device.

  On success, ret1 contains the actual number of characters
  written to the console device which may be fewer than the
  requested number of characters.

  If ret0 (status) is non-zero, then no characters have been written
  to the device and ret1 is not valid.


3 cons-read API Call

  Entry:
	trap#		FAST_TRAP
	function#	CONS_READ
	arg0		raddr
	arg1		size

  Exit:
	ret0		status
	ret1		characters read or special value

  Errors:
	ENORADDR	Invalid real address
	EWOULDBLOCK	Cannot complete operation without blocking
	EIO		I/O error

  Reads up to 'size' characters from the console device and
  places them in the buffer specified by the 'raddr' argument.

  On success, ret1 contains either a special value (CONS_BREAK,
  CONS_HUP as per CONS_GETCHAR) or the number of characters placed
  into the buffer which may be fewer than the requested number of
  characters.

  If ret0 (status) is non-zero, then no characters have been read from
  the console device and ret1 is not valid.


4 cons-write-buffer-size Machine Description Property

  The optional integer property 'cons-write-buffer-size' in the machine
  description's 'platform' node provides a hint as to the
  size of the console device's internal output buffering.


5 cons-read-buffer-size Machine Description Property

  The optional integer property 'cons-read-buffer-size' in the machine
  description's 'platform' node provides a hint as to the
  size of the console devices's internal input buffering.
