Sun4v Hypervisor Error Handling Interfaces [APPROVED DRAFT]
-------------------------------------------

NOTE:
    This document describes the error handling interfaces for CPU, memory
    and programmed I/O errors. The error handling interfaces for host bus
    adapter errors and directly accessible I/O device errors are still
    being developed and are not described in this version of the document.

1.0 Introduction

Hardware errors which do not reset the system generate a trap to the
hypervisor. The hyperprivileged trap handler virtualizes the errors
from the CPU, memory, and virtual I/O devices like the host bus
adapter, and sends an error notification to the affected guests. For errors
that do not reset the guest, an error report indicating the impact of
the error is sent to the guest. Section 5 of this document
describes the structure of the error report sent to the guest.

Errors from devices that are directly accessed by the sun4v guest are not
virtualized by the hypervisor. They are handled by the device drivers of
the sun4v guest.

The sun4v architecture[1] defines two classes of errors based on their
impact on the interrupted instruction stream: resumable errors and
non-resumable errors. Resumable errors are those that do not affect the
current instruction stream. Non-resumable errors are those that affect
the current instruction stream and require software intervention before
the interrupted instruction stream can be resumed.

The sun4v architecture defines queues for the hypervisor to send error
reports to its guests. The sun4v error reports for CPU, memory, and PIO
errors are queued on to the resumable error queue or non-resumable
error queue depending on the type of the error. The sun4v error reports
for errors in virtual or direct I/O devices are queued on to the
dev_mondo queue.

The simplest implementation of a sun4v guest could, for example,
simply perform a 'retry' on resumable error notifications and 'panic'
on non-resumable error notifications. But the intent is to have enough
information in the hypervisor generated error reports to the sun4v guests
such that an advanced guest would be able to take corrective actions
and make forward progress when possible.

The remainder of this document is divided as follows. Section 2 defines
new terms introduced in this document.  Section 3 describes the sun4v
hypervisor error handling philosophy. Section 4 provides a brief
overview of the hypervisor generated error notifications for errors.
Section 5 describes the sun4v error handling interfaces. Section 6
describes the hypervisor error handling principles of operation.

2.0 Terms and Definitions

2.1 Diagnosis Service Provider. The platform is expected to include
an FMA Fault Manager that provides a Diagnosis Service for the hardware
components. The diagnosis service must provide a transport for FMA
Error Reports, and can be implemented on any of the following:
	(1) The only sun4v guest partition on the platform
	(2) A sun4v service partition
	(3) The Service Processor
The diagnosis service implements the appropriate hardware diagnosis
algorithms and triggers corrective actions, messaging, and other tasks
resulting from the diagnosis of a fault in the platform hardware.

2.2 FMA Error Report Generator Service Provider. If a hypervisor implementation
does not itself produce FMA Error Reports, then an FMA Error Report Generator
must be implemented to convert the hypervisor implementation-specific error
data structures to FMA Error Reports and transport them to the diagnosis
service.

2.3 Service Provider Interface. A platform-specific Service Provider 
Interface must be implemented on the platform to transmit hypervisor
generated error reports to the FMA Error Report Generator (if one is 
required) or to the Diagnosis Service Provider (if the hypervisor
itself produces FMA Error Reports).

For information on Sun SPARC error terminology, please refer to [2].

For more information on FMA, see http://fma.eng.

3.0 Philosophy

The sun4v hypervisor error handling philosophy is based on the
following principles:
	(1) Abstract the underlying hardware characteristics from
	    errors reported to a sun4v guest so as to enable
	    sun4v guest error handlers to be implemented without
	    built-in knowledge of the underlying hardware implementation.
	(2) Provide a separate mechanism to report errors for analysis
	    and diagnosis of hardware faults that should be subscribed
	    to by the FMA Error Report generator and diagnosis service provider.

4.0 Brief Overview of Error Notifications

Hardware errors which do not reset the system trap to the
hypervisor.  For each error handled by the hypervisor:
	(1) If the error does not reset the sun4v guest, then a sun4v error
	    report that virtualizes the underlying hardware error and
	    describes the impact of the error is sent to the sun4v
	    guest.
       (2) A service error report containing the raw error logs
	    captured by the hardware and additional diagnostic data is
	    sent to the diagnostic service provider.

As shown in Figure 1 below, the sun4v error report is sent to the
affected sun4v guest via the queues defined by the sun4v
architecture. The service error report is sent via the Service Provider
Interface to the FMA Error Report Generator which sends an FMA Error Report
to the Diagnosis Service Provider.

   Fig 1. Hypervisor Error Reports to sun4v Guest and FMA Service Provider

Some notes on Figure 1 above:
	(1) Virtual I/O refers to devices that cannot be directly accessed
	    by the guest. They are either complete abstractions of
	    the underlying physical devices, like virtual console
	    device, or are indirectly accessed using hypervisor calls,
	    like to access the host bus adapter.
	(2) The CPU, memory, and virtual I/O errors are diagnosed
	    by the Diagnosis Service Provider based on the service error
	    report data sent.
	(3) Direct I/O device errors are handled by the sun4v guest device
	    drivers. Hardened drivers generate FMA Error Reports. Those FMA
	    Error Reports are sent to the FMA Agent (as shown in Figure 1) on
	    the sun4v guest and are forwarded to the FMA Agent on the
	    Diagnosis Service Provider. Forwarding the FMA Error Reports may
	    not be necessary if the Diagnosis Service Provider and the sun4v
	    guest are on the same partition.
	(4) The sun4v error report is a virtualized error report used by 
	    the sun4v guest, and is not the same as the FMA Error Report
	    that captures platform-specific information for the Diagnosis
	    Service.

Figure 1 shows the error reports generated by the hypervisor when handling
hardware errors and how they are propagated to the Diagnosis Service
Provider and the sun4v guest.

The sun4v error report is sent to the sun4v guest. The CPU, memory,
and PIO error reports are sent via the sun4v resumable_error and 
nonresumable_error queues. Both virtual and direct I/O device error
reports are sent via the sun4v dev_mondo queue. These queues are allocated
per CPU. Each queue has a head and a tail pointers. When the queue is
empty, the head and tail pointers are equal. The hypervisor queues
the error report at the tail and updates the tail pointer to the next
entry.

For resumable_error and dev_mondo queues, the hardware generates a
disrupting trap whenever the head and tail pointers are not equal. The
disrupting trap is taken on the CPU if the interrupts are enabled 
(PSTATE.IE = 1) or remains pending if the interrupts are disabled.
The sun4v guest interrupt handler processes the sun4v error reports starting 
from the head pointer to the tail pointer (excluding) and updates the 
head pointer to equal the tail pointer leaving the queue in
a non-interrupting state.

For nonresumable_error queues the hardware does not generate a trap
automatically when the head and tail pointers are not equal. The hypervisor 
emulates a nonresumable_error trap on the CPU by transferring control to the
nonresumable_error trap handler of the sun4v guest. The sun4v guest
trap handler processes the sun4v error reports starting from the head
pointer to the tail pointer (excluding) and updates the head pointer to
equal the tail pointer.

For direct I/O device errors, the sun4v guest hardened device drivers
generate the FMA Error Report to be sent for diagnosis. For CPU, memory, and
virtual I/O device errors, the sun4v guest does not generate FMA
Error Reports, instead an FMA Error Report is generated based on the service
error report sent via the service provider interface.

The service error report is sent to the FMA Error Report Generator and
Diagnosis Service Provider via a platform-specific interface called
the Service Provider Interface. The FMA Error Report Generator receives
the error logs and diagnostic data from the hypervisor and generates
an FMA Error Report. It sends the FMA Error Report to the Diagnosis Service
Provider for analysis and diagnosis.  The error recovery actions based
on the platform's SERD policies and failure rates are then communicated
back to the guests (not shown in Figure 1). Please refer to the
proposed FMA Error Report Generator and Diagnosis Service Provider
architecture[3] for more information.

The sun4v guest error reports and the error reports sent through the
Service Provider Interface each contain an Error Handle (see 5.2.1)
that can be used to correlate the reports.

This document describes the sun4v error reports for CPU, memory, and
the virtual host bus adapter errors. For a description of the service
error reports, please refer to the platform's FMA and Service Entity
documentation.

4.1 PIO store errors.

Note that this error report format is *not* used for PIO store errors. These
errors are reported to the guest using a different, I/O specific format.
See [4] for details.

5.0 Sun4v Error Handling Interfaces

This section describes the sun4v error handling interfaces as a
supplement to the Error Model section in the sun4v architecture
specification[1].

5.1 Classification of Errors
An error as defined in [2] is when a signal or datum is wrong.
Hypervisor classifies the hardware errors into three classes:
	(1) Resumable errors, where the error does not affect the
	    current instruction stream.
	(2) Non-resumable errors, where the error affects the current
	    instruction stream and requires software intervention before
	    the program can be resumed.
	(3) Unconstrained or terminating errors, where the error results in
	    a loss of system coherency and/or data integrity that continuing
	    execution can lead to further damage. 

For unconstrained or terminating errors, a sun4v error report is not queued
to the affected sun4v guests; the affected guests are reset. 

For resumable and non-resumable errors, a sun4v error report is queued
to the affected sun4v guest. The sun4v architecture[1] defines the
resumable, non-resumable, and dev_mondo queues, and their workings.

All I/O error interrupts are resumable errors as they are derived from
asynchronous interrupts generated by I/O devices and do not affect
the current instruction stream. However, their error reports are queued
on the dev_mondo queue to be handled by the nexus and device drivers of
the sun4v guest. The structure of the i/o error reports [TBD] is different
from the sun4v error reports for CPU, memory and PIO errors defined
in section 5.2 of this document.

Regardless of the class of the error, the hypervisor creates a service
error report and attempts to deliver it to the FMA Error Report Generator.
Upon receipt of a service error report, the FMA Error Report Generator
creates an FMA Error Report and attempts to deliver it to the Diagnosis
Service Provider for error recovery and fault diagnosis. In the case where
the Diagnosis Service Provider is implemented on the sun4v guest which
is fatally affected by a non-resumable error, the FMA Error Report may 
not be successfully delivered to the diagnosis service.

5.1.1 Resumable Errors
For an error that is a resumable error, the originating error may
either be corrected by the hardware or hypervisor, or left unchanged.

If the originating error was corrected, then the guest is not sent
an error report. However, a service error report is sent to the
Diagnosis Service Provider via the service provider interface
for fault analysis.

Some examples of hardware errors that are not reported to the guest because
the error was corrected are: correctable ECC error in cache data, TLB
data parity error, cache data parity error in a clean cache, and 
uncorrectable ECC error in a clean cache line.

If the originating error was left unchanged, then an error report is
sent to the affected guest. The impact of the error on the sun4v
guest, for example, whether there was memory corruption or whether a
CPU became unavailable, is indicated in the error report.

Some examples of hardware errors that are reported as resumable errors
where the originating error was left unchanged are: uncorrectable data ECC
error on cache writeback, transaction timeout on a PIO read, data parity
error on a PIO read data return, bus error on a PIO read, and
recursive unrecoverable errors on a CPU. In the case of an
uncorrectable data ECC error on cache writeback, the memory region that
was corrupted is indicated in the error report. In the case of
recursive errors on a CPU, the ID of the CPU that was
marked in error along with the execution mode of the CPU at the time of
the error are indicated in the error report. In the case of
a failed PIO transaction, the PIO transaction address is indicated in
the error report.

5.1.2 Non-Resumable Errors
For an error that is a non-resumable error, the originating error is
not corrected. The sun4v error report indicates the location of the 
originating error. These errors require the intervention of the sun4v
guest error handler to take corrective actions, when possible,
before resuming or terminating the interrupted program. For example,
the guest may use the hypervisor call to scrub the memory region in
error indicated in the error report.

A non-resumable error may be reported to the sun4v guest as
either a precise trap or a deferred trap. The error report descriptor
indicates the trap type. When multiple error reports
are queued, the deferred error reports will be queued ahead of the
precise error report according to the age of the instructions that
induced the errors.

Some examples of hardware errors that are reported as non-resumable
errors are uncorrectable data ECC error in cache on loads,
instruction fetches, or atomics from a dirty line, uncorrectable ECC
error in DRAM on loads, instruction fetches, or atomics, and an
uncorrectable ECC error in a CPU's register file. For
uncorrectable ECC errors in the memory hierarchy, the non-resumable error
report indicates the memory region in error. For uncorrectable ECC
errors in register files which can be cleared, the register file as well 
as the the ID of the CPU whose register file had the error are
indicated in the error report.

5.1.3 Unconstrained or Terminating Errors
Unconstrained or terminating errors are not reported to the sun4v guest
OS. They result in resetting the sun4v guest. In some cases, the
hardware generates a reset trap, and in others the hypervisor resets
the sun4v guest.

Some examples of hardware errors that are treated as unconstrained or
terminating errors to the guest are Niagara's L2 cache tag parity error
and L2 cache directory parity error, ROCK's store buffer address or
control parity error, and Niagara's TLB tag parity error. The L2 cache
tag and directory parity errors are detected by hardware which causes a
warm reset of the entire chip. For store buffer address or control
parity error, the hardware generates a deferred trap to the
hypervisor which resets the affected partitions. For the TLB tag parity
error the hardware generates a precise trap to the hypervisor which
resets the partitions using that TLB.

Recursive errors on a CPU may result in the resetting of the
partition if that results in all of the CPUs in that partition 
to be in error.

5.2 Sun4v Error Report For CPU, Memory, and Programmed I/O (PIO) Access
The sun4v error report for CPU, memory, and PIO access errors is a fixed
length error report that describes the underlying hardware error in
terms of resumable or non-resumable error to the sun4v guest. The
intent is to have enough information in the error reports to enable an
advanced guest to take corrective actions, when possible, and make
forward progress. The sun4v error report is not meant for hardware
fault analysis or diagnosis.

On startup, the sun4v guest and the hypervisor exchange the versions
that they support and pick the latest version that is compatible.
Please refer to [1] for more information. 

The table 5.2-I below describes the format of the sun4v error report record.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	    Table 5.2-I. Sun4v Error Report Format

5.2.1 Error Handle (EHDL#). This field specifies the handle of the error.
Error handles are unique opaque values that will not be reused until
the hypervisor in the hardware domain is restarted. If multiple error reports
are generated for the same error, they will all have the same EHDL value.

5.2.2 Stick register (STICK). This field specifies the contents of the
%STICK register that was captured by the hypervisor trap handler.

5.2.3 Error Descriptor (DESC). This field specifies the type of the
error report. The table 5.2.3-I below lists the currently defined values.
 	------------------------------------------------------------
 	Value	Mnemonic	Description
 	------------------------------------------------------------
	0	UNDEF		Undefined
 	1	R_UE		Uncorrected resumable error report
 	2	NR_PR  		Precise non-resumable error report
 	3	NR_DF 		Deferred non-resumable error report
 	------------------------------------------------------------
		Table 5.2.3-I. Error Report Descriptors

All other values are reserved.

The value R_UE is valid only for error reports that are queued on
the resumable_error queue. The values NR_PREC and NR_DEF are valid only
for the error reports that are queued on the nonresumable_error queue.

5.2.3.i Uncorrected resumable error report. An uncorrected resumable
error report is always queued on the resumable_error queue of a CPU
that belongs to the affected partition. It specifies that the
underlying error was not corrected. The resource in
error is specified by the ATTR (5.2.4) field of the error report.

An uncorrected resumable error report is used to indicate a CPU in
error. For example, in a partition with multiple CPUs when a permanent 
error in a register file of a CPU is detected, the CPU is marked in error and
an uncorrected resumable error report indicating the CPU in
error is queued on a different CPU of the same partition.

When the only running CPU in a partition is in error, the partition 
is reset.

5.2.3.ii Precise non-resumable error report. A precise non-resumable error
report is always queued on the nonresumable_error queue of the CPU
that executed the instruction that induced the error. It specifies
that the nonresumable_error trap taken is a precise trap where TPC[TL] points
to the instruction that induced the error. The error report contains
enough information about the error for the guest to take appropriate 
actions before resuming or terminating the interrupted instruction
stream. The location of the error is specified by the ATTR (5.2.4) field 
of the error report. A hypervisor call is provided for the guest to 
scrub the error location.

When multiple non-resumable error reports are queued on the
nonresumable_error queue of a CPU the deferred error reports will be
queued ahead of the precise non-resumable error reports.

5.2.3.iii Deferred non-resumable error report. A deferred
non-resumable error report is always queued on the nonresumable_error
queue of the CPU that executed the instruction that induced the
error. It specifies that the nonresumable_error trap taken is a
deferred trap which means that the error is unrecoverable and the
instruction stream should be terminated. The location of the error is
specified by the ATTR (5.2.4) field of the error report. The MODE
(5.2.4.vi) field in the ATTR specifies the execution mode in which the
error occurred.

When multiple non-resumable error reports are queued on the
nonresumable_error queue of a CPU the deferred error reports will be
queued ahead of the precise non-resumable error reports.

5.2.4 Error Attributes (ATTR). The meaning of this field depends on the
error descriptor (see 5.2.3) of the error report. It also includes
the resumable queue full indicator (see 5.2.8).

In uncorrected resumable error reports, this field specifies the resource
affected by the error. When a CPU has an uncorrected error, whether
the CPU was executing in user or privileged mode, if known, is also
included in the error report. 

In precise non-resumable error reports, this field specifies the
location in error.

In deferred non-resumable error reports, this field specifies the
location in error as well as the execution mode in which the error
occurred, if that can be determined.

The settings of this field also determines which of the additional information
included in the error report have valid contents.

The table 5.2.4-I below describes the format of this field.

5.2.4.i CPU Field. In an uncorrected resumable error report, the CPU
bit when set specifies that a CPU belonging to the same partition is in
error. The ID of the CPU in error is specified by the CPUID (see
5.2.5) field in the error report.

The CPU bit is not used in non-resumable error reports.

5.2.4.ii MEM Field. In uncorrected resumable error reports and in
non-resumable error reports, the MEM bit when set specifies that there
exists an uncorrected data error in the memory hierarchy. The
uncorrected error could be either due to a bad ECC syndrome or NotData.
The starting real address and the size, in bytes, of the affected
memory region are specified by the RA (5.2.6) and SZ (5.2.7) fields in
the error report, respectively.  Subsequent reads from the affected
memory region would also generate an error unless there was an
intervening hypervisor call to scrub the memory error. A hypervisor
call is provided for the guest to scrub the memory region in error.

The MEM field and the PIO field (5.2.4.iii) cannot be set in the same
error report.

5.2.4.iii PIO Field. In non-resumable error reports, the PIO bit when
set specifies that an unrecoverable error was encountered on a PIO
access. The PIO address accessed is specified by the RA (5.2.6) field
in the error report. The I/O device corresponding to the PIO transaction
that failed can be determined based on the PIO address specified by
the RA field in the error report.

The PIO bit is not used in resumable error reports.

The PIO field and the MEM field (5.2.4.ii) cannot be set in the same
error report.

5.2.4.iv IRF Field. In precise non-resumable error reports, the IRF bit
when set specifies that a non-permanent uncorrectable error in the
integer register file occurred when executing that instruction (pointed
to TPC[TL]). The data in one or more register operands of that
instruction has been corrupted by the error, but the source of error
has been cleared.

The IRF field is not used in uncorrected resumable error reports.

NOTE: For permanent errors in the integer register file of a CPU, 
the CPU is marked in error. An uncorrected resumable error report
is sent to a different CPU in the same partition indicating the
ID of the CPU in error.

5.2.4.v FRF Field. This is same as the IRF (5.2.4.iv) field except that
when set it specifies that the error was in the floating-point register
file instead of the integer register file. Please see IRF (5.2.4.iv)
description for more information.

5.2.4.vi Execution Mode (MODE). This field specifies the execution
mode of the operation that induced the error.
The table 5.2.4-III below lists the currently defined values.
 	---------------------------------
 	Value	Description
 	---------------------------------
	0b00	Unknown
	0b01	User mode
	0b10	Privilege mode
	0b11	Reserved
 	---------------------------------
	 Table 5.2.4-III. Execution Mode

The 'Unknown' execution mode will be used in error reports when the
hypervisor cannot determine the CPU's state at the time of the error.

5.2.5 ID of the CPU (CPUID). This field specifies the ID of the CPU 
affected by the reported error. It is valid when the ATTR field in
the error report has either the CPU, IRF, or FRF bit set.

5.2.6 Real Address (RA). This field specifies the real address associated
with the error. If the MEM bit in the ATTR field in the error report
is set, then this field contains the starting address of the memory
region affected by the error. If the PIO bit in the ATTR field in the
error report is set, then this field contains the PIO transaction
address.

5.2.7 Size of the Memory Region (SZ). This field specifies
the size in bytes of the memory region affected by the reported error.
It is valid when the MEM bit in the error attributes (ATTR) field is set.

5.2.8 Resumable queue is full (RQFULL). This field applies only to
resumable error reports. When set, it specifies that zero or more
resumable errors might have been dropped since the queueing of that
error report and the next one.

6.0 Hypervisor Error Handling Principles of Operation

This section describes the principles of operation of the hypervisor
error handlers.

6.1 Handling of Errors
6.1.1 Corrected Errors
For hardware corrected errors where the error is not automatically
cleared, the hypervisor attempts to clear the source of the error by
writing back the corrected data (an attempt to clear a stuck-at bit
will fail). For example, if a correctable ECC error was reported on a
L2 cache line or DRAM memory, the hypervisor will attempt to write the
corrected data back to the error location.

6.1.2 Uncorrectable Errors
6.1.2.i Register errors
For uncorrectable errors in the processor's integer or floating-point
register files, the hypervisor attempts to clear the source of
the error by writing a test pattern to the register and reading it
back.  If the error in the register cannot be cleared due to a
stuck-bit, then the CPU is stopped and a resumable error (uncorrected
resumable error report) indicating the CPU in error is sent to another
CPU of the same partition. If the uncorrectable error in the register
is cleared, a precise non-resumable error report is reported to the
guest on the CPU that took the trap with the register that was reported
in error containing an undefined value.

6.1.2.ii Cache errors
For uncorrectable errors in the processor caches, the hypervisor
clears the error from the cache by flushing the cache line with the bad
data to memory as long as there is no expansion of data poisoning or
corruption (which is determined based on the granularity of the error
protection in the processor caches and memory.) If the flushing of the
cache line with the bad datum would result in the expansion of data
poisoning or corruption, the hypervisor leaves the bad data in the
cache when reporting the error to the guest. (The guest can use the
the hypervisor call to scrub the bad data which clears the cache line
in error by filling it with zeroes and flushes it to memory.) If the 
cache line with the bad data is clean, then the hypervisor evicts the
line with the bad data out of the cache.

Here is an example. Suppose that the L2 cache has ECC protection for every 4
bytes and DRAM memory has ECC protection for every 16 bytes. In this
case, an uncorrectable error in the L2 cache would mean that there are
4 bytes of bad data. If the line containing the error was modified,
then flushing the line out of the cache to the memory would expand the
error to 16 bytes of bad data because the ECC protection granularity of
memory is 16 bytes. That would result in the expanding the data
corruption from 4 bytes to 16 bytes. To avoid such expansion, the
hypervisor will not attempt to clear the uncorrectable error that was
detected in the L2 cache line.

6.1.2.iii Cache writeback errors
For uncorrectable errors during cache writebacks, if the processor
turns the signalling error to a non-signalling error thereby resulting
in data corruption, the hypervisor will regard the writeback error as an
unconstrained error and reset the affected guests. If the uncorrectable
error on a cache writeback remains a signalling error after the writeback,
then a uncorrected resumable error report is sent to the affected
guests.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that processors do not convert
	a signalling error to a non-signalling error on cache writebacks.

6.1.2.iv Memory errors
For uncorrectable memory errors, the hypervisor does not attempt to
clear the source of the error. The hypervisor notifies the sun4v guest
of the memory region in error. The sun4v guest is responsible for
its recovery policy. It can scrub the memory region in error using the
hypervisor call to scrub memory, which clears the memory region in
error by filling it with zeroes. The hypervisor call to scrub memory
should return an error code to the guest if the scrub was not successful.
Hypervisor should also notify the Diagnosis Service Provider about
the scrub operations performed on behalf of the guest.

6.1.2.v CPU "error" state
When hypervisor puts a CPU in error state, it must ensure the following:
	(1) Hypervisor calls targetting CPUs in error state should
	    return an error code to the guest indicating that one or more
	    of the targetted CPUs are in error state.
	(2) The guest cannot restart the CPU that is in error state.

6.2 Reporting of Errors
The guidelines for reporting errors are:
	(1) All errors are reported to the FMA Error Report Generator
	    and sent to the Diagnosis Service Provider.
	(2) Always report an error that generates a precise or deferred trap
	    to the CPU that took the trap unless the CPU is marked in error.
	(3) For disrupting errors, notify only the affected guests
	    as can be determined based on the error information logged.
	(4) Errors in shared memory are reported to all of the affected
	    guests. If the error was a precise or deferred error, then
	    a non-resumable error report is sent to the guest that
	    induced the operation, and a resumable error report is sent
	    to the other guests that share the memory region in error.
	    If the error was a disrupting trap (for example, as generated by a
	    hardware scrub operation), then a resumable error is sent
	    to all of the affected guests.
	(5) Hypervisor should set the RQFULL bit in the error attributes
	    field of the resumable error report that makes the queue full.
	    (A queue is said to be full when the tail pointer if incremented 
	    equals the head pointer.) Hypervisor drops the resumable error
	    reports if the resumable error queue if full. The setting of the
            RQFULL bit in the resumable error report indicates to the
	    guest that zero or more resumable errors might have been 
	    dropped since the queueing of that error report.
	(6) If the nonresumable_error queue of a CPU is non-empty or
	    if it does not have enough room to queue the error report(s),
	    then the hypervisor marks that CPU in error and sends a
	    resumable error report to a different CPU of the same partition.
	    If all the CPUs in a partition are in error, then the
	    partition is reset.
	(7) Errors in virtualized I/O devices should be reported to only
	    the affected guests.

6.3 Handling Correctable Error Storms
The hypervisor must attempt to prevent a storm of correctable errors
from pinning the system in the hypervisor for long periods of time.
This is done by disabling correctable error trap generation on the CPU
that just took a correctable error trap for a finite period. At the
expiration of the period, if no correctable errors are logged on that
CPU then the correctable error trap generation is reenabled. The
period for which the correctable error trap generation is disabled on a
CPU is determined based on platform policy and can be tuned from
the platform's Diagnosis Service Provider.

6.4 Collecting diagnostic data for errors
For errors, the hypervisor must perform CPU-specific work to gather
information required to populate the service error reports for diagnosis.
Please refer to the CPU's Error Handling document for more information.

6.5 Switch Guest to New Hardware
	TBD

7.0 Rules for future expansion

All bits of DESC/ATTR word are significant, including reserved bits.
New errors not covered in the current specification will be indicated
by using reserved bits in one or both of these two fields.

If a guest CPU encounters an non_resumable_error trap, and the error
payload contains an unrecognized encoding in the DESC/ATTR word, the
guest is recommended to terminate.

Reserved fields in in the structure from offsets 0x26-0x3f may be any
value.  Hypervisors implementing the current spec will fill these fields
with zeroes; however, guests implementing the current spec should not
rely on this, but should ignore the fields altogether.
