I am sponsoring this fast-track for Kevin Rathbun.  This case
introduces PRI update domain service.  See details in the attached
one-pager. The timer for this case is set to December 21, 2006.

One-pager is also available at,

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2006/701/materials/PRI_DS_one-pager.txt


Note that this case uses PRI data structures in the payload which
are going to be documented via another FWARC case (2006/700). I am
working on the final set of changes on the PRI case with Kevin.  The
PRI DS interfaces uses existing domain services protocol to transfer
PRI data. The PRI data structures are part of the payload for the PRI
update domain service and hence are imported interfaces.  Changes to
PRI data structures because of ARC review would not have any affect
on the PRI DS interfaces itself (except the payload).


Thanks.

2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

        This case will describe the domain service interface that a client 
        may use to request Physical Resource Inventory (PRI) information.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        We need to time the changes such that both SP and Solaris changes are 
        available and released at the same time.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

        Having complete identity information will reduce time to diagnose by
        eliminating extra data gathering steps.  In many cases gathering 
        this data will involve extra phone calls and/or emails to customer.  
        We need a way to provide specific FRUID information in FMA events 
        to SP.

        To address this problem we need a way to transport PRI information to
        the Control Domain.   
        
        This project proposes an interface to update PRI information over
        a domain service channel.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Huron/Maramba platforms, means to satisfy key requirement for
        Serviceability (S12Y).

   3.3. Business Justification:
        Reduces problem remediation time (time spent by service team) 
        Enables Automatic Radiance Case Creation and Routing (aka ACCR)
        Estimated cost saving to Sun for Huron/Maramba only: @ $3.89 M 

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        As noted above, an enabler for ACCR, which improves Sun's service
        call response time and accuracy.	

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Solaris s10u4_b3

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into both Solaris Nevada
        and S10u4_b3 as well as vBSC gates.

4. Technical Description:

    4.1 Overview

         The PRI is intended to contain various kinds of information about a 
         system.  Much of this information has previously been contained in
         the Machine Description (MD).  The PRI domain service will facilitate
         access to this information from the Control Domain.

         The SC will generate the PRI and send PRI Update Messages containing
         the PRI to the Control domain  using domain service. The messages 
         will generally be sent when the initial domain service registration 
         occurs. They may also be sent asynchronously on a channel when the 
         PRI is updated by the SC.  Control domain will respond to the PRI
         update message by sending a PRI update response.  See following
         sections for the details.

    4.1.1 PRI domain service 1.0

         The version of the domain service describe below is 1.0.
    
    4.1.1.1 Service ID

         There is one service IDs defined to support the PRI update 
         capability.

         The following service ID should be added to the Domain Services
         registry for the PRI update capability.

         Service ID                Description
         ----------                ----------------------------------
         "pri-update"              PRI update domain service


    4.1.1.2 PRI Update Message
    
         The PRI Update Message header contains a 64-bit message number
         and a 64-bit size. It is followed by the PRI data.

         Offset Size   Field name    Description
         ------ ----   ----------    ----------------------------------
         0       8     pri_msgnum    Message number
         8       8     pri_size      Size of the PRI data
         16     Var    pri           PRI data

    4.1.1.3 PRI Update Response

         There will be one PRI update response for each PRI update message.
         The PRI Update Response has the following format.

         Offset Size Field name     Description
         ------ ---- ----------     ------------------------------------
          0      8    pri_msgnum    Message number responding to
          8      8    status        Status of PRI Update

    4.1.1.4  pri_msgnum

        The pri_msgnum is the message number in the PRI Update header which 
        is a monotonically increasing number that uniquely identifies each 
        message.  Responses to messages are expected to use the same message 
        number so that they can be paired with their original message.

        New messages may be issued without waiting for a response to a
        preceding message.  The underlying transport protocol is responsible
        to ensure reliable, in-order and unduplicated message packets.

        Messages are to be processed in the order received.


    4.1.1.5 Response Status Codes

         Name                      Value    Definition
         ---------------------     -----    ---------------------------------
         PRI_UPDATE_ACK            0x00     PRI Successfully Received and 
                                            Verified
         PRI_UPDATE_INVALID_MSG    0x01     Message Payload Invalid
         PRI_UPDATE_INVALID_PRI    0x02     PRI Format Invalid

Can you implement this service without understanding the
format of the data structures?

Maybe this should be a single case, and put on hold till it's
ready?

Yes you can.

I agree.  Instead of waiting for the PRI data approved before this case
is submitted I would like to review FWARC the PRI DS (this case) interfaces.
Whatever the PRI format happens to be after that case get approved will
be used as a payload.

We can either conditionally approve or approve both cases together.

BTW, PRI case is close to submission too.  In a day or two it will
be submitted.


Thanks.

I forgot to mention that this case requests minor/micro/patch OS
binding and minor/micro binding for the firmware.

This case would have timed-out today but some last minute findings
have resulted into changes to the specification.  Project team is
working on a revised specification.  I am changing the state of
this case to "waiting need spec".  The case will resume with new
timer once updated specification is available.


Thanks.

Hitendra,

So that I can update jade code to increase the alarm time for poll-tty 
to 10 and to see the result, is it ok?

Thanks,
Yu Kong

As long as you don't *leave* it at 10ms. If you just want to try it,
that's one thing, but changing it for everyone else is a problem.

This case is ready for review again.  I have attached the latest
one-pager with the specification in section 4.  The link below
has been updated with the latest one-pager.

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2006/701/materials/PRI_DS_one-pager.txt


I am extending timer for this case to a week from today, to January 10, 
2007.

This case requests minor/micro/patch OS binding and minor/micro binding
for the firmware.


Thanks.

2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

        This case describes the domain service interface through which a 
        client obtains the Physical Resource Inventory (PRI).

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        We need to time the changes such that both SP and Solaris changes are 
        available and released at the same time.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

        Having complete identity information will reduce time to diagnose by
        eliminating extra data gathering steps.  In many cases gathering this 
        data will involve extra phone calls and/or emails to customer.  We 
        need a way to provide specific FRUID information in FMA events to SP.

        To address this problem we need a way to transport PRI information to
        the Control Domain.   
        
        This project proposes an interface to deliver PRI information over
        a domain service channel.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Huron/Maramba platforms, means to satisfy key requirement for
        Serviceability (S12Y).

   3.3. Business Justification:
        Reduces problem remediation time (time spent by service team) 
        Enables Automatic Radiance Case Creation and Routing (aka ACCR)
        Estimated cost saving to Sun for Huron/Maramba only: @ $3.89 M 

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        As noted above, an enabler for ACCR, which improves Sun's service
        call response time and accuracy.	

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Solaris s10u4_b3

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into both Solaris Nevada
        and S10u4_b3 as well as vBSC gates.

4. Technical Description:

    4.1 Overview

         The PRI is intended to contain various kinds of information about a 
         system.  Much of this information has previously been contained in
         the Machine Description (MD).  The PRI domain service will facilitate
         access to this information from the Control Domain.

         The SC will generate the PRI and send PRI Update Messages to the
         Control Domain to indicate that it has changed. The domain may then
         send a request for the PRI, to which the SC responds by delivering
         a message containing the PRI.

    4.1.2 PRI domain service 1.0

        The version of the domain service describe below is 1.0.
    
    4.1.2.1 Service ID

        The following service ID should be added to the Domain Services
        registry for the PRI service capabilities.

        Service ID                Description
        ----------                ----------------------------------
        "pri"                     PRI domain service

    4.1.2.2 Message Header Formats

        All PRI Messages have the same header format consisting of a
        Message Number and a Message Type.

        The Message Number is a monotonically increasing number that uniquely 
        identifies each message. Responses to messages are expected to use 
        the same message number so that they can be paired with their original 
        message. The Message Number may also be used to distinguish between
        multiple instances of the same message type.

        New messages may be issued without waiting for a response to a
        preceding message.  The underlying transport protocol is responsible
        to ensure reliable, in-order and unduplicated message packets.

        Messages are to be processed in the order received.

        The Message Type is used to distinguish the different message types.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type

        Message Type  Value
        ------------  -----
        PRI Request   0
        PRI Data      1
        PRI Update    2

    4.1.2.3 PRI Request Message

        A PRI Request Message is sent by the client to request that
        the current PRI be delivered.

        The Message Number value will be used in the PRI Data Message
        sent in response to this request.

        The Message Type field should indicate a PRI Request Message.

        There is no data payload for this message type.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type


    4.1.2.4 PRI Data Message

        A PRI Data Message is sent to the client in response to a request.
        Its payload consists of the current version of the PRI.

        The Message Number field contains the value in the request being
        fulfilled. If the client has subsequently sent a new request the
        service may choose to ignore a data response with an older number. 

        The Message Type field should indicate a PRI Data Message.

        The PRI field has variable length and corresponds to the complete PRI. 

	The PRI Data follows the PRI Message Header and its size is determined 
        by the PRI header itself which is specified in the sun4v machine 
        description case imported by this case.

        Offset Size   Field
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
        16      Var   PRI Data

    4.1.2.5 PRI Update Message
    
	The PRI update message is sent by the service asynchronously to the 
        client indicating that an update to the PRI is available. The client is 
        responsible for requesting the actual PRI data if and when it requires 
        it after being notified of an update.

	The service guarantees to send an update message if the PRI is modified 
        at any time after a PRI data message has been sent.

        A PRI Update Message contains a unique 64-bit number in the
        Message Number field. Each PRI Update Message should be uniquely
        identifiable so that the client can determine when to make another
        PRI Request.
        
        The Message Type field should indicate a PRI Update Message.

        There is no data payload for this message type.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
