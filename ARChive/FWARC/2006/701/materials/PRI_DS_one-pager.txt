2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

        This case describes the domain service interface through which a 
        client obtains the Physical Resource Inventory (PRI).

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        We need to time the changes such that both SP and Solaris changes are 
        available and released at the same time.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

        Having complete identity information will reduce time to diagnose by
        eliminating extra data gathering steps.  In many cases gathering this 
        data will involve extra phone calls and/or emails to customer.  We 
        need a way to provide specific FRUID information in FMA events to SP.

        To address this problem we need a way to transport PRI information to
        the Control Domain.   
        
        This project proposes an interface to deliver PRI information over
        a domain service channel.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Huron/Maramba platforms, means to satisfy key requirement for
        Serviceability (S12Y).

   3.3. Business Justification:
        Reduces problem remediation time (time spent by service team) 
        Enables Automatic Radiance Case Creation and Routing (aka ACCR)
        Estimated cost saving to Sun for Huron/Maramba only: @ $3.89 M 

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        As noted above, an enabler for ACCR, which improves Sun's service
        call response time and accuracy.	

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Solaris s10u4_b3

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into both Solaris Nevada
        and S10u4_b3 as well as vBSC gates.

4. Technical Description:

    4.1 Overview

         The PRI is intended to contain various kinds of information about a 
         system.  Much of this information has previously been contained in
         the Machine Description (MD).  The PRI domain service will facilitate
         access to this information from the Control Domain.

         The SC will generate the PRI and send PRI Update Messages to the
         Control Domain to indicate that it has changed. The domain may then
         send a request for the PRI, to which the SC responds by delivering
         a message containing the PRI.

    4.1.2 PRI domain service 1.0

        The version of the domain service describe below is 1.0.
    
    4.1.2.1 Service ID

        The following service ID should be added to the Domain Services
        registry for the PRI service capabilities.

        Service ID                Description
        ----------                ----------------------------------
        "pri"                     PRI domain service

    4.1.2.2 Message Header Formats

        All PRI Messages have the same header format consisting of a
        Message Number and a Message Type.

        The Message Number is a monotonically increasing number that uniquely 
        identifies each message. Responses to messages are expected to use 
        the same message number so that they can be paired with their original 
        message. The Message Number may also be used to distinguish between
        multiple instances of the same message type.

        New messages may be issued without waiting for a response to a
        preceding message.  The underlying transport protocol is responsible
        to ensure reliable, in-order and unduplicated message packets.

        Messages are to be processed in the order received.

        The Message Type is used to distinguish the different message types.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type

        Message Type  Value
        ------------  -----
        PRI Request   0
        PRI Data      1
        PRI Update    2

    4.1.2.3 PRI Request Message

        A PRI Request Message is sent by the client to request that
        the current PRI be delivered.

        The Message Number value will be used in the PRI Data Message
        sent in response to this request.

        The Message Type field should indicate a PRI Request Message.

        There is no data payload for this message type.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type


    4.1.2.4 PRI Data Message

        A PRI Data Message is sent to the client in response to a request.
        Its payload consists of the current version of the PRI.

        The Message Number field contains the value in the request being
        fulfilled. If the client has subsequently sent a new request the
        service may choose to ignore a data response with an older number. 

        The Message Type field should indicate a PRI Data Message.

        The PRI field has variable length and corresponds to the complete PRI. 

	The PRI Data follows the PRI Message Header and its size is determined 
        by the PRI header itself which is specified in the sun4v machine 
        description case imported by this case.

        Offset Size   Field
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
        16      Var   PRI Data

    4.1.2.5 PRI Update Message
    
	The PRI update message is sent by the service asynchronously to the 
        client indicating that an update to the PRI is available. The client is 
        responsible for requesting the actual PRI data if and when it requires 
        it after being notified of an update.

	The service guarantees to send an update message if the PRI is modified 
        at any time after a PRI data message has been sent.

        A PRI Update Message contains a unique 64-bit number in the
        Message Number field. Each PRI Update Message should be uniquely
        identifiable so that the client can determine when to make another
        PRI Request.
        
        The Message Type field should indicate a PRI Update Message.

        There is no data payload for this message type.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
