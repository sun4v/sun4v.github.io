I am sponsoring this case for Kevin Rathbun.  This case defines
Physical Resource Inventory (PRI) structures.  The data in the
PRI are represented very much like Machine Description structures.
See details in the attached one-pager and the specification.

The timer is set for December 22, 2006.


Thanks.

2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

        This case will describe the Physical Resource Inventory (PRI).

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        None.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

        With the advent of Logical Domain (LDOM) support in sun4v systems, it
        is now possible for a guest to execute on a subset of the full system
        resources. In this condition, the information contained in the guest
        MD provided to that guest will only represent virtual resources that
        have been allocated to it.
        
        Having complete identity information available to guest will reduce
        time to diagnose by eliminating extra data gathering steps.  In many
        cases gathering this data will involve extra phone calls and/or emails
        to customer.  We need a way to provide specific FRUID information in 
        FMA events to SP.  PRI intends to provide this information.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Huron/Maramba platforms, means to satisfy key requirement for
        Serviceability (S12Y).

   3.3. Business Justification:
        Reduces problem remediation time (time spent by service team) 
        Enables Automatic Radiance Case Creation and Routing (aka ACCR)
        Estimated cost saving to Sun for Huron/Maramba only: @ $3.89 M 

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        As noted above, an enabler for ACCR, which improves Sun's service
        call response time and accuracy.	

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Solaris s10u4_b3

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into both Solaris Nevada
        and S10u4_b3 as well as vBSC gates.

4. Technical Description:

    4.1 Overview 

         The PRI is intended to contain physical information about a 
         system.  Much of this information had previously been  contained in 
         the Machine Description (MD), but with the advent of  Logical Domains 
         (LDoms), it becomes essential to have a clean separation  between the 
         physical and virtual views of a system.  To achieve this, much of  the 
         physical information is no longer part of the MD within a guest domain.  
         This provides a strictly virtual view of the system within an LDom. 

         However, besides the service processor, other management  entities (e.g. 
         FMA, the LDom Manager) still require a physical view of the  system.
         This is now provided by the PRI.  The PRI includes not only the physical 
         information which is no longer available in the MD (needed by FMA to  
         perform diagnosis); it also contains additional information about the 
         system,  necessary for the LDom Manager to successfully configure &
         manage individual  logical domains, including acting as a template for
         the LDom Manager to  construct MDs for the various logical domains it 
         is managing. 

         See the specification for details.

Version 1.0
Date : 12/15/2006


This is the specification for the Physical Resource Inventory (PRI). The PRI
is intended to contain physical information about a system. Much of
this information had previously been contained in the Machine Description (MD)
provided to the guest. With the advent of Logical Domains (LDoms), it becomes 
essential to have a clean separation between the physical and virtual views of 
a system. To achieve this, much of the physical information is no longer part 
of the MD within a guest domain. This provides a strictly virtual view of the 
system within an LDom.

However, besides the System Controller (SC), other management entities (e.g. 
FMA, the LDom Manager) still require a physical view of the system. This is 
now provided by the PRI. The PRI includes the physical information which is no 
longer available in the MD (needed by FMA to perform diagnosis). It also
includes additional information necessary for the LDom Manager to configure and
manage individual logical domains, including acting as a template for the LDom 
Manager to construct MDs for the various logical domains it is managing.

The PRI is provided by the System Controller (SC) to the domain. The PRI
contains physical information about system resources in a format identical
to that used by the guest MD. The names for the nodes and properties used 
to access that information are defined to be platform independent, as are 
many of the values. Some of the values may be platform-dependent and may 
require additional documentation to parse them.

The PRI may be updated at anytime on the SC depending on the state of its 
resources. Protocols and transports may be agreed upon with the domain for 
delivering the PRI to it so that it may use the information for activities 
such as configuring LDOM guest domains or diagnosing error data.

One of the primary consumers of the PRI on the domain is the LDOM Manager. It
uses the PRI to generate guest MDs by extracting information from it that
serves as a template for new domains. The PRI may contain any of the nodes and 
properties that may be found in a guest MD on a system. For this reason, this
case imports all past and future cases that specify new nodes or properties for 
the guest MD that may be used on a system. Since future cases cannot be 
explicitly imported, any new cases that arise should specify that they apply
to both the guest MD and the PRI.

In addition to containing the information needed by the LDOM Manager for 
creating guest MDs, the PRI also supplies the information it needs to generate
the hypervisor data needed to boot a set of configured guest domains. This
hypervisor data may include information about either the SC or other firmware
components that it needs to know about. Some items in this specification in
this category include the LDC endpoints and host prom information.

Another of the primary consumers of the PRI are FMA modules such as diagnosis
engines. There is a requirement to provide additional information in the PRI
so that FMA may make diagnoses and act on them through fault, repair or logging
actions. To enable this, the PRI contains system-wide information that may not
be available in the guest MD in the domain on which FMA modules are running. As 
an example, FMA modules running in the control domain (the single domain running
the LDOM Manager) may handle ereports generated for resources owned by other
guest domains in the system. It may access the PRI to get information it needs
to diagnose and act on data in the ereports. For more background, see the FWARC
case 2006/141 FMA Domain Services. 

In addition to the requirements spelled out in the FMA Domain Services case, 
there is a requirement to add additional information to the PRI so that FMA
may generate reports with more specific details about components that have been
diagnosed faulty. Some of this information is available in a FRUID present on 
the component or on another component that is proxying the information. It
is the responsibility of the SC to derive this information for components 
present on a system and to populate the relevant property values in the PRI.

The PRI also represents how components are contained within other components
in a hierarchical fashion in the system. Each component can be identified as a 
FRU or not based on a property. The parent component that contains each 
component can also be found by following an arc property back to it. Based
on this, for any component in a system, its closest parent component that is a
FRU can be found so that it may be replaced if faulty. There should be only one
parent component for each component, but a component may have multiple children
components if they are all physically contained by it. The idea of a component
physically containing another component is meant to indicate how they may be
removed or replaced and is determined on a platform-specific basis.
