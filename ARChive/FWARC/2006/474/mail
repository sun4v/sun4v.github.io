I'm sponsoring this fast track for Tayfun.
This fast-track times out on Aug 16 2006.

The case updates the HV PCI IO API spec, originally
defined in 2005/112.

Specifically, this case updates the iotte attributes
to support requestor-id based key validation
in iommu mappings and the ability to request the
relaxed ordering attribute in the iotte, available on Niagara 2,
so the update affects pci_iommu_map and pci_iommu_getmap APIs.
(Only the attributes argument and return in these 2 APIs
change.)

The attribute additions are upwards compatible with the
previous spec.

This case will update the API versions of these
interfaces to v1.1 in the PCI IO API group,
0x100. The registry entries will be updated
upon approval.

The completely updated spec is in the file
materials/io-api.txt

The entire SCCS file is in the materials
dir, so you can easily see the differences
between versions.

Commitment levels remain Sun Private and
the case seeks a minor or micro binding for
firmware changes and minor/micro or patch binding
for any OS changes using the new attributes bits.

-David

Regarding the new 'phantom function' bits, is encoding 0 (zero) of
these bits equivalent to the behavior in version 1.0 of the
API (since there is no 'enable phantom function' bit)?

The new spec is unclear about bits 15:6 and 3 of the attributes:
"Bits 63:2 are unused" got replaced by "Bits 63:32 are unused",
leaving some bits unaccounted for.

I have two minor nits with the new spec text:

The descriptions of the bit fields are not in the same order as
they are in the bit diagram.

In the description of the 'L' bit, the text refers to the bit by a
different name: "is permitted to ignore the RO bit"

Yes.

00b means no function number bits are used for phantom functions.

Do they have to be in the same order?

The project team will need to respond to your other 2 issues.

yes, even bit 4, 7-14 are unused

We can fix this issue too.

We should replace "RO" with "L".

Either Tayfun or myself will update the spec with these changes and let 
you know.

No - just that having the bits in the same order tends to confirm
the correctness of the layout.
