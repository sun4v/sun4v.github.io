Niagara2 Network Interface Unit - Hypervisor API

    Introduction

	This document describes a new Niagara2 Network Interface Unit
	(NIU) Hypervisor API which becomes available on Niagara2
	based platforms.

	This interface provides the guest with the ability to set and 
        get the NIU DMA channels' logical page configuration information.

    API Versioning

	This interface will abide by FWARC/2006/052 with respect
	to versioning.  The interface presented here represents
	version 1.0.

	See section on Export Interfaces below for specific API
	group-number.

    Function Number

	The following function numbers define the primary NIU entrypoints
	per the Sun4v Hypervisor API:

        N2NIU_RX_LP_SET          0x142
        N2NIU_RX_LP_GET          0x143
        N2NIU_TX_LP_SET          0x144
        N2NIU_TX_LP_GET          0x145


NIU API Definitions

 1. niu_rx_logical_page_set
        trap#           FAST_TRAP
        function#       N2NIU_RX_LP_SET
        arg0            chidx
        arg1            pgidx
        arg2            raddr
        arg3            size

        ret0            status

    Configure a mapping described by arguments raddr and size in the NIU
    recieve DMA engine address translation (logical page) register
    indicated by chidx and pgidx.

    If there is already a valid mapping for the page specified by pgidx, 
    that mapping is overwritten.

    The specified mapping is un-configured if the size is 0. In this case, 
    raddr is ignored.

    chidx must be between 0 and 15.

    pgidx must be 0 or 1.

    raddr must be size aligned.

    size must be a power-of-2.

   errors
        EBADALIGN       Invalid alignment for raddr or size
        ENORADDR        Invalid real address
        EINVAL          Invalid index for channel or register

  2. niu_rx_logical_page_get
        trap#           FAST_TRAP
        function#       N2NIU_RX_LP_GET
        arg0            chidx
        arg1            pgidx

        ret0            status
        ret1            raddr
        ret2            size

    Return the current mapping in the NIU recieve DMA engine address
    translation (logical page) register indicated by chidx and pgidx.  The
    real address and size are returned in ret1 and ret2.

    chidx must be between 0 and 15.

    pgidx must be 0 or 1.

    If there is no current mapping for the given chidx and pgidx, then the 
    return values raddr and size will both be 0.

   errors
        EINVAL          Invalid index for channel or register
 
  3. niu_tx_logical_page_set
        trap#           FAST_TRAP
        function#       N2NIU_TX_LP_SET
        arg0            chidx
        arg1            pgidx
        arg2            raddr
        arg3            size

        ret0            status

    Configure a mapping described by arguments raddr and size in the NIU
    transmit DMA engine address translation (logical page) register
    indicated by chidx and pgidx.

    If there is already a valid mapping for the page specified by pgidx, 
    that mapping is overwritten.

    The specified mapping is un-configured if the size is 0. In this case, 
    raddr is ignored.

    chidx must be between 0 and 15.

    pgidx must be 0 or 1.

    raddr must be size aligned.

    size must be a power-of-2.

   errors
        EBADALIGN       Invalid alignment for raddr or size
        ENORADDR        Invalid real address
        EINVAL          Invalid index for channel or register

  4. niu_tx_logical_page_get
        trap#           FAST_TRAP
        function#       N2NIU_TX_LP_GET
        arg0            chidx
        arg1            pgidx

        ret0            status
        ret1            raddr
        ret2            size

    Return the current mapping in the NIU transmit DMA engine address
    translation (logical page) register indicated by chidx and pgidx.  The
    real address and size are returned in ret1 and ret2.

    chidx must be between 0 and 15.

    pgidx must be 0 or 1.

    If there is no current mapping for the given chidx and pgidx, then the 
    return values raddr and size will both be 0.

   errors
        EINVAL          Invalid index for channel or register
