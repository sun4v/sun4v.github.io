Please can we have PDF files of the documents - having to run staroffice
to read the materials is unacceptable.

Hi

I have listed some issues related to this case ..

1.2.1 - can you also put LDC in parentheses same place where it
is being spelt out for the first time.

1.2.1, 2nd para - you are using the acronym 'DS' for the first time
can you expand this further in the first para of this section.

2.3 - the word "..following.." is slightly misleading in the
first sentence.

2.3.{1,2,3} minor nit, Can you make it more clear that the value
here is msg_type. I presume the structure here defines the content
of the payload .. The size of the payload will then correspond
to the size of this structure .. - correct ?

2.4 It is implicit in the explanation here why you dont send back
a major version in the ACK or what the minor version means. The minor
version in the ACK means that you support the corresponding major
version and all the minor version <= the version in the ACK. Right ?

2.5.4 would it make sense to add a line or two to state when
a DS_REG_NACK will be sent.

2.5.5 4th para, I dont see anywhere in your structures the status
field you are referring to here. There is no msg format defined
for the error response.

3.{1,2,3}.1 There is no explanation of what the seqno in
these requests are for.

3.2.1 what is the 'ms_delay' value for.

Thanks

-Narayan

[1] Section 2.5.1.3 Register Failed

Are the values of 'svc_handle' and 'major_vers' valid for all cases for
which NACK is generated? Even for DS_REG_NACK & DS_REG_DUP?

Please explain status DS_OK - 'NACK with Status=Success' sounds
confusing. I think DS_OK is really returned when the major version do
not match and 'major_vers' contains supported major version. If that
right, it needs to be added to the document.


[2] Sections 2.5.5 & 256

'ds_handle' is not defined in any of the structures in previous
sections. Is 'ds_handle' same as 'svc_handle' ?


Other issues are already covered by Narayan's issue list.

Regards,
Sunit

A simple flow chart of how a domain services provider/consumer 
negotiates capabilities with respect to the versioning would be much 
easier to understand than a textual step-by-step description. Of course, 
it's up to the project team to decide if they want to implement that.

Appendix A should be some sort of registry, not just an appendix to a 
document in the materials directory (similar to the hypervisor API 
registry, or the vendor FCode registry).

Will OBP be expected to support DS? If so, can we present the structures 
in block/packet format instead of C-style so there are no endianness issues.

All other issues covered by other members.

FYI.  The specification will be available by early Tuesday for
review on Monday, February 27th. 

I am working with Eric on final set of changes.  If you want to
have an early access of the specification then Eric can send you
an early version of it which is close to final version (few small
changes are possible from now till late tomorrow).

The specification will include following additional services.

- CPU DR
- CPU Offline
- Mem. Page Retire
- LDom variables store (primary & backup)

The LDOM variables store service was part of 2006/086 but
we decided to move it to Domain Services case.


The project team would like this case be reviewed on February 27th.
Thus, we will have two cases to review (2005/320 and 2006/055).


Note that the specification would have been available by end of Monday
but it is Sun Holiday and I won't be available tomorrow.  I will try
to copy the specification by late Monday or early Tuesday.


Thanks.

The material has been copied in the case directory and available at,

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2006/055/commit.materials/DomainServices-093.pdf

(StarOffice file is also available in the commit.materials directory)


Sherri, please put this on agenda for February 27th.  I suggest you
put this on the first slot and put Sunit's OPL case (2005/320) on
the second slot.


Thanks a lot.

Some last minutes inaccuracies were detected yesterday and team would
like to correct them.  The project team would also like to remove the
FMA section (3.5 and 3.6 in the version .93 of the document).  The FMA
services (CPU offline and memory retire) will be submitted as another
case later on.

I have copied the latest version (0.96) and the delta pdf file so that
you can see the "delta" between 0.96 and .93 versions of the document.
Both versions are also in the case directory.  Following links may
be useful for you to review the specification.

Sorry about these changes but project team thought of correcting
them before the actual review takes place this week.

The review will take place this Monday (02/27).  I have not seen an agenda
go out about the review this Monday.  I think Sherri is on vacation.
I will prepare and send out an agenda today.


Thanks.

Eric has sent me updated domain services specification.
I have copied it in the commit2.materials directory.
Both PDF and StarOffice versions are available.  The new
specification has addressed all of the issues raised
at the meeting today.

I have also created a PDF file to see the "delta" between
the updated document and the one we reviewed on Monday.

I am still working on the interface table.  It will be
available later today (Tuesday).

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/arc/FWARC/2006/055/commit2.materials/DomainServices-097_096_delta.pdf


The changes seems straight forward to me.  I don't think these set of
changes requires another meeting of review.  My preference is to "vote"
via e-mail after I publish the interface table.

Can we review it via e-mails?  Let me know your thoughts.


Thanks.

I object to email only review. That means we'll review
this on Monday, since any member can request a review.

A few issues after a brief look:

In 2.3.1, why are the major and minor version fields only
2 bytes each? What's the size of the major and minor version
fields in the rest of the interfaces we've already approved?

2.5.1 does not define a result code for Success (0), nor
a description that success is returned unless otherwise
noted. In prior cases, I believe that Hitendra has asked
for the success code be listed as a possible return value
for each function that can return 0. (the wording needs
to change to accommodate that.)

2.5.2.1 major/minor version field sizes.
2.5.2.2   "
2.5.2.3   "

Finally, the issues file doesn't show the resolution
of the new issues, and lists them as OPEN.

I guess that depends - for example the hypervisor versioning api 
effectively takes 64bit major and minor numbers - while that's the 
natrual size for something carried in a machine register it is excessive 
for a message packet we are trying to keep relatively short.

Even though the LDC reliable protocol will allow us to build LDC packets 
longer than the basic link-layer 64B packet, it is more effective if we 
don't have to do so - so the intent here was to save unnecessary packet 
expansion. Nearly all of the DS request & responses will fit into a 
single LDC 64B packet.

We can set the version field sizes to anything we want, but we estimated 
that 65535 major versions was likely to last us a while. Assuming 
Solaris moves to a bi-monthly release schedule and we update the service 
for each Solaris release the major version field should last us a little 
over 10000 years ;-)

Success or failure is determined by the message type. For example, a 
register request results in one of two message reply types: ack or nack. 
The failure code is obviously only necessary for the nack case and would 
therefore never have a value signifying 'OK' - since by design no 
failure code of 'OK' is ever necessary, none is defined.

There are hundreds of ways to implement this - the team tried to pick a 
mechanism that was relatively straightforward; for several of the domain 
services the success reponses required one packet format, while the 
failure responses required another (e.g. to return a failure reason 
string for logging). Consequently it is easier to key off a different 
message type than to have to look in the packet for a failure code 
before the code can decipher the remainder of the packet.

See discussion above; all the sizes are consistent I think.

Agreed, we need to fix this.

But the versioning APIs that were approved did not restrict
the fields to a specific subset of values within those 64-bit
fields.

Pragmatically speaking, since the OBP cif interfaces effectively
only take 32-bit encoded integers, we at least implicitly agreed that
they will fit into a 32-bit encoded-integer. (otherwise
the interface would have been
( ... major.hi major.low minor.hi minor.low ... )

If you want to revisit the versioning API cases and
restrict the fields to 16 significant bits, I have
no problem with that. I do have a problem with randomly
assigning different sized fields for the same elements
when the #significant bits hasn't been defined.

Call me anal if you want to, but that's my position
and I'm sticking with it. :) (In other words, I agree
with your logic, though I haven't checked the match,
but interfaces must be consistent and well-defined
throughout.)

I'm pretty sure that all the version negotiation
requests and replies are far less than 64 bytes,
since the only info is the short header the request/reply
codes and at most 2 version number fields. I'd have
to check to make sure, but I'll leave that up to you.

We spent a lot of time arguing for consistency in these
interfaces. (both in the field names and everywhere else.)

By virtue of the CIF interface the values within the 64bit major & minor 
fields are then already restricted to the range 0...2^32-1. ? Except of 
course the HV API spec doesn't specify that restriction ... should we 
consider the CIF interface or HV interface broken ?

The versioning APIs had 64bit values only because that was the size of 
the machine registers not because we needed 64bit values. The registry 
of versions starts at 1.0. The only valid values are the ones specified 
in the registry - so the interface does not have arbitrary 64bit values 
- and realistically speaking the range needed is very small.

In reality, the values start at 1.0 and are defined as we need them 
moving upwards - with luck we'll all be retired long before we ever see 
more than a few handful of values - if we can apply pragmatism in one 
case (the CIF) cant we apply it this one too ?

I don't see why these cases are linked, nor are the fields randomly 
assigned - they are well defined in their respective specs. Defining a 
certain size field for this interface doesn't mean we have to go back 
and re-define the range of bits for a totally independent interface. 
They are different interfaces negotiating different versions for 
different things ...

OK, you're being .... ;-) The field sizes dont really matter for the 
project - the only thing that has bearing on the current definitions was 
the impact on the overall packet size ...

With 64bit fields the registration request packet would look something like:

words 0-1 - LDC header
word  2   - DS packet header
word  3   - service handle
word  4   - major #
word  5   - minor #

Leaving 16 bytes for a nul terminated name string without over flowing ....

.. we can change the numbers to 4 bytes each - increasing the string 
length to 24 bytes, or leave them at 2 bytes each leaving a 28byte 
string field.

Consistency is good where it makes sense, but don't try to force all the 
service protocols to use the same field definitions .... remember that 
the purpose of the overall domain services protocol is that it is simply 
a transport for packets.

Each of the service protocols is a complete, separate and independent 
protocol - they do not interact with each other in anyway - that's why 
they each have their own version negotiation.

You might think of the DS transport as like TCP - ensuring that packets 
get to a specific application or module registered with a port (in this 
case service handle). Other than that there is/should be no constraints 
on the protocols DS carries - any more than TCP dictates the protocol 
for telnet, smtp, or ssh.

ash.

Perhaps. I think a well-specified interface *should* specify the
permitted range of values, especially if the permitted range
is less than the size of the field.

I think what we should do is go back to the HV API, and add
the supported range of values in those fields. (fast track
with updated spec would be fine.)

But I was pointing out that the cif or the HV API is incorrect,
since the sizes of the fields don't match. Sorry, I've only
realized that because of this discussion.

Oh man .. that sounds a lot like what those of us that were
programming in the 70's said. Basically, the life cycle of
software projects was supposed to be on the order of 5 - 7
years back then, though look at all the software that
survived from those days (and needed to be "fixed") for y2k.

Yes, I won't disagree with that, however, in my experience,
it makes life much easier if similar interfaces use similar
definitions. Doing otherwise makes things much more confusing
for those that come after us.

I realize it's convenient to use 64 byte packets because
of our current implementations. When we have a convenient
instruction and/or cache-line size of 128 bytes, do we start
optimizing for that size, and at the same time still support the
older machines using a 64-byte packet size? It's a
rhetorical question, but illustrating the implementation-
specific nature of the current optimized packet size.
And, no, I'm not saying it's unimportant to do that.
We have to optimize for performance where possible.

What else could you possibly add to a version negotiation
API besides the service id and the major, minor version?

32-bits are good. But at the same time, it would be good
to revise the HV versioning API with a fast-track, specifying
the value limits. (Strictly speaking, they are separate
interfaces, but I still think there's a lot of value in
making these interfaces consistent.)

Fair enough, but if the protocols are arbitrary, what's the harm
in trying to make them look consistent? Do they have to be consistent?
No, you and the project team and the other fwarc members that pointed
that out are correct about that, but why shouldn't
they be consistent? Making them consistent, where possible, makes it
much easier to not screw things up in the future, and also provides
the benefit that once you've learned how a couple of them work at
the protocol layer, you now know how they all work at the protocol
layer.

Is this something that FWARC gets to enforce? No, not if the
interfaces themselves are complete and supportable, however
we are permitted to make suggestions. And I just want to point
out that the suggestions are not intended to be arbitrary.

I thought we had - isn't that what the registry of API versions is for ?

By all means - you want to drive a fast track case to say that version

True - I'd buy the argument if the fields were one byte, but even if we 
rev the major version upwards once a week - as fast as we can submit 
FWARC cases ;-) With two bytes we're good for over 1000years. I don't 
know about you, but honestly I'm not going to be worrying out peoples 
problems with the LDoms architecture in 3006 ... ;-)

I agree - that's why within the scope of domain services we kept the 
fields the same size, and follow the same algorithm for negotiation, but 
the document makes the version number fields pretty clear ...

64bytes are baked in all over sun4v - not least for the mondo and error 
queues. If we need to change them however we at least have the 
versioning interface to cope with that ...

The service is defined by the name string. This is specified with a 
short hand cookie (8bytes) so that once registered a caller can use the 
cookie only and no longer needs to refer to the name ... the cookies are 
dynamically allocated (they are not a defined namespace) and mean 
nothing until bound to a name with the registration request.

I think the versioning registry covers it, but we can run a fast track 
to add a note to the registry to restrict the range ...

I think we've tried to make them consistent within the space of domain 
services - are they identical with *all* sun4v protocols and APIs - no. 
Now that we have versioned interfaces anyway, it's likely that each 
interface can have inconsistent definitions just by virtue of the 
specifics of each interface version that has been selected.

No the suggestions are good and welcome, I just wanted to point out the 
reasoning behind the selections we have.

OK, there is a precedent. Section 7.1 of the HV API document defines
a cpuid as a 16 bit value, and a cpulist as an array of 16-bit
cpuids. That's the reference I missed. Thanks.

The project team can change v-cpuids back to 32-bits or even
16-bits if they want to. Thanks for bearing with me on this,
even though it turned out I was wrong.

I give up on the size of the version fields. 2 bytes is fine.

Write the fast-track up to define a major and minor version
number as 16-bit values and I'll sponsor it. (modifies
the HV versioning API case, this case doesn't depend on
that change.

---------------

The registry just lists the interfaces and the trap#/function#
assigned to an interface. (major.minor needs to be added,
per the HV API case.) It doesn't, by itself, define any interface,
but it's the official registry where the values assigned appear, so no
project gets values that are formally assigned to another project.
The list has to be somewhere, it might as well be maintained by
FWARC since any case that defines a new HV API has to go through
FWARC.

FYI.  I mentioned this yesterday, the "id" property under CPU
node in MD is defined to be 64bit value.  The "id" property is
defined as,

   A unique 64-bit unsigned integer identifier for the virtual
   CPU. This identifier is the one to use for all hypervisor CPU
   services for the CPU represented by this node.

Is MD property size is still 64bit or has it changed to 16bits?

Hi Hitu,

All MD properties are defined to be 64bits.

The issue here is the valid range of values - which is basically 
architecturally constrained to 0-65535.

We could go back and scatter this over all the docs we have, but I think 
the precident David mentioned and that it is specified in the sun4v 
architecture spec should suffice given that all these interface spec 
back reference the same core specs.

cheers,

ash.

The specification is updated one more time based on e-mail
discussions from today.  Lets review 0.9.8 version of the
document next Monday.  The material is copied into case
directory at,

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/arc/FWARC/2006/055/commit2.materials/DomainServices-098.pdf

The differences from 0.9.6 version which we reviewed yesterday can be
seen in,

Remember, since we moved the meeting back to 11:00,
it's possible I'll be a little late today.


Minor comments only.

editorial: "NULL terminated" should be "NUL Terminated"
throughout the document. (It's the ASCII NUL character
that terminates a c-string.)

In 2.5.2, the definition of svc_id should include
"NUL terminated ASCII string" (as it does in the
rest of the document, where strings are used.)

After these (and any other new issues) are fixed,
and the issues list updated to show the resolutions
of all the "open" issues, we can convert to fast-track
approval.

-David

Hi

I have added an interface table to the Domain Services case
directory. I have also marked the corresponding issue as now closed.

Hi

Please review the revised document containing changes for all
the comments/issues from commitment-2 review.

http://sac.sfbay/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2006/055/ 
commit2.materials/DomainServices-099.pdf

If this addresses all the issues I will delete version 0.98 in the
commitment-2 directory.

Thanks

Thanks Narayan.

FWARC members, this case is now converted into a fast-track.
I will mark it approved as fast-track case by end of today
around 6 pm PST.  If you have any comments or wants to extend
the timer past today then let us know ASAP.

I will also remove the intermediate versions of the document
later today.


Thanks.

I have created domain services registry under FWARC home page.
You can get to it from,

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/arc/FWARC/

Scroll down by a page and you will see list of FWARC Registries.
You will find both Hypervisor API and Domain Services registry.

Let me know if you have any comments.


Thanks.
