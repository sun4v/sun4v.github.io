The issue list for 2005/111. All the issues are closed. 

issue #1 from DK:
SUNW,set-trap-table .. the cif has another argument for the miss area.  

Answer from DK:
This will be fast-tracked in later. The sun4v version has an
additional argument for the miss area.



Issue #2 from DK:
An unamed cif for dealing with HV API versioning negotiation via OBP
with the hypervisor.

Answer from DK:
This will be fast-tracked in later.
It doesn't exist yet. Details need to be worked out on this.



Issue #1 from HZ:
section 2.2.1.3, Unit Address Representation
provides examples which includes "/cmp@100".  Since
cmp nodes does not exists under sun4v architecture
we may want to not mention CMP anywhere in the document.
I suggest changing "/cmp@100" to "cpu@100".

Answer from DK:
changed it from "cmp" to "cpu" and deleted reference [6].



Issue #2 from HZ:
Section 9.1.2 mentions that cpuid is 28-bit quantity.
This is significantly large value then what we have
dealt with in past.  E.g., the cpuid for UltraSPARC-III,
III+, IV, etc. is just 10 bits.

What I would like to know (more of a curiosity) is how
sun4v Solaris uses the cpuid.  Are the CPU related structures
based on the 28 bit CPUIDs?  Is NCPU 28 bit quantity?
May be concept of NCPU does not exist in sun4v Solaris.

I would like brief discussion on this at the meeting.

Answer from DK:
This is closed as a non-iussue.
