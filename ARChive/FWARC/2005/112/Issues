Inception: 2005/112 sunv4 io API

=====================================================

1.  18Q, Q# 15, last bullet refers to "some measurable effect.."
     Have measure the boot time effects?  Similar question for
     the core API case (2005/116) states that there are no measurable
     boot time effects.  So, is this true that IO APIs have boot
     time effects but the core APIs don't?

     Further, for the same answer, it states that the systems that
     implement sun4v tend to be larger systems.  I don't think this
     is true.  Sun4v is implemented on Ontario and Niagara-2 based
     smaller systems.

Following comments/issues are for IO API specification version 1.29.

2.  Section 1, middle of third paragraph seems to have a typo.
     "Results 0 - 5 are returned in %o0 - %o4" seems to be incorrect.
     I think the correct sentence is "Results 0 - 4 are ..."/

3.  Section 5.1, we may want to have registry for MSI function
     numbers.  Is there a reason why we skipped 0xcf?

4.  Section 5.3.13, typo, the last word should be "msiqid".

5.  Section 5.3.13.1, typo, "msium" should be "msinum".

6.  Section 5.3.17, typo, the last word should be "msiqid".
