I'm sponsoring this case as a fast-track for David Redman.
The fast-track timeout is March 23, 2005

This case defines an optional set of HV APIs. This optional
set of APIs defines the data link layer transport of a
pair of communication endpoints. The APIs are hardware
independent. Also included is a set of machine description
nodes and properties required to define service endpoints,
and some binding information for those service endpoints.

The specification is in the materials subdir of the
case dir.

The requested binding is minor release, the committment
level of all interfaces is Sun Private.

This case reserves FAST TRAP (0x80) function numbers
0x80 .. 0x84 for the APIs defined by the case, and
these FAST TRAP function numbers should be documented
in the registry being created by 2005/116.

-David

I was going to send my comments to Dave Redman today but since
this case is already submitted I am sending comments using the
case number to everyone.  Some of my comments are probably result
of me not familiar with the machine descriptor case. I am going
to review the machine descriptor case soon.  I reviewed this case
as a higher priority because David Redman, and others specifically
asked me to review it.

General comments :

0.  Goes without saying but the new APIs will need to be added
     to the registry.  I think the core API case should create
     the registry ASAP.

1.  This case seems to be dependent upon the FWARC/2005/115
     which defines the machine description and also core APIs case.
     I have not reviewed 2005/115 and hence I am having little hard
     time understanding some of the details in this fast-track case.
     This tells me that one can not review (or may be approve) this
     case until the other case is reviewed.

     I think the approval of this case may depend upon the changes
     that may be result from the review of 2005/115 case.  Hopefully,
     2005/115 goes through with very few changes in it.

2.  From the service API spec it self it is not clear how one gets
     the SID.  Is this part of machine descriptor?  If so then please
     clarify this in section 2.2.

3.  The MTU seems to be associated with SID as per section 3.1.2.
     Are MTU also part of machine descriptor?  This can also be
     clarified in section 2.2.

4.  What OBP virtual devices uses the SVC APIs?  NVRAM is one
     of them, are there any other?  I am assuming that the device
     bindings for NVRAM and other virtual devices using SVC APIs
     will be submitted to ARCs for review in future.

Comments specific to various sections in the specification.

5.  Section 3.2.2, I am little confused with the statement,
     "this is write-1-set operation".  As per table in section
     2.3, bits 1, 2 and 15 are write-1-clear.  So, what happens
     if someone tries to "set" these bits.  Is this an error?

6.  Section 3.2.3, similar confusion with respect to the statement
     "this is a write-1-clear operation".  Again as per table in
     section 2.3, there are bits which are not w1c.  What happens
     to this bits when someone tries to write 1 using the
     svc_clrstatus API?

7.  Section 4.1.1, what are "back" and "fwd" properties?  I have
     a feeling that these are defined in the machine descriptor case.

8.  Section 5.1.1, typo in the description of "reg" property.
     The "identity" is misspelled as "identify".

9.  Section 6, nit, the state diagram is good but got me confused
     with the "svc_clrstatus, Clear RX bit" action in the lower right
     corner.  It would have been clearer if this was to the right of
     the circular arrow going up to the first circle "Ready to RCV".


I am going to review the machine descriptor case and if I have more
comments after I review it then I will send them out.


Thanks.

The machine description section of the document and the device template
are effectively informative text in this case. They describe how the
information is provided to the guest.

4.1.2, sid property. sid is just an opaque 'handle'.
5.1.1, sid property. (derived from the md sid property in 4.1.2)

This case exports the interfaces to use for obp, etc., and the example
nodes are specified. Why would we need another case here, Hitendra?
That would be overkill in my opinion. (It's up to the platform and
implementation how it uses this stuff and what it uses it for.)
The informative examples of the md, device node template, etc
should be sufficient here.

I think it ignores those bits. Dave should clarify this.

back and fwd should be removed from this doc. (my opinion). They
aren't required to describe the required properties for a service
endpoint.

You're kidding right? I helped Dave with the state diagram. When I
move the text up, it screws up the dotted line going to the TX side.

I understand that the spec is describing the APIs and how it gets
various values etc. are defined else where and hence informative
but I am little confused about the device template.  Are you referring
to section 5?  If so then I thought section 5 is part of this case
and it actually defines the properties for virtual devices which
uses service APIs.  Thus, section 5 can not be an informative
section.

What I am suggesting it that clarity in section 2.2 will be helpful
since SID as an argument is used in sections prior to 4.1.2.
Note that I was asked by Dave to comment on his specification
yesterday.  And these are my suggestions only.  I am not insisting
on these changes.

Where are the example nodes specified?  I only see mention of NVRAM.

The section 5, first paragraph states that "the property values
are all extracted from the MD, and nodes are created under the
/virtual-devices node for each platform_service found in the
Machine Description".

So, isn't it true that each of the platform_service will have
a corresponding OBP device node under /virtual-devices node?
Each of these nodes will have unique "name" and "compatible"
properties.  Aren't the values of these two property need
to be documented/reviewed?  Is Solaris a consumer of these
properties?  I think answer is no, right?

So, when platform implements these nodes, they do not have to
submit a fast-track for it, right?  I just want to be clear here.

No I was not kidding.  I noticed the dotted line but then I thought
may be there is a way to have curved dotted line going to TX side.
Anyway, this is just a nit for clarity.  No changes are needed.

There's a new version (0.44) of the spec in
the materials directory addressing most of
Hitendra's questions.

Added fwd reference to 4.1.1 in section 2
for MTU and SID sources.

Clarified that set/clrstatus only affects bits
that can be cleared or set.

Added section 5.2, describing specific nodes
on Great Lakes platforms.

The timeout is unchanged (March 23)

Thanks a lot for above changes.

I noticed that the values for "compatible" property is missing
from all of the tables in section 5.2.  Does this mean there are
no Solaris drivers loaded for any of these virtual device nodes
and hence the compatible property is not created for these nodes?

If "compatible" property is an optional property then I think
that need to be made clear in section 5.1.1.

Section 5.2.4 includes value for "device_type" property but the
section 5.1 states that "device_type" property is not required
for these nodes.  Further, this property is not defined in section
5.1.1 which implies that this property is not needed.

So, does NVRAM node really need "device_type" property?  If it is
needed then I suggest we change the last sentence of section 5.2
to, "Unless stated .....  no device methods or device_type property."
And also change section 5.1 to that the "device_type" property or
methods are not required for most nodes (instead of stating that
these are not required, state that these are not required for most
nodes).

BTW, there is still a typo in the description of the "reg" property
in the section 5.1.1, replace "identify" with "identity".

I have couple of question related to the "seek" method defined in
section 5.2.4 Page 11.

svcapi document defines "seek" method as:

    seek ( offset type -- fail? )

which is not standard/1275 "seek" method   { seek ( hi lo -- fail? ) }

while the svcapi document says that the methods are "standard" methods
used by OBP 4.x.


Also, the description of 'type' parameter is a bit confusing. Is the
following correct?

* When type=0, offset can be 0..N (all positive, N is the device size).

* When type=1, offset can be either positive or negative.

* Document says that for type 0 & 2, offset is positive, but for type=2
isn't the offset going from high to low? Offset should be negative in
the type=2 case?


Regards,
Sunit

"compatible" is optional.

It isn't required. It's optional.

The detailed description of the "nvram" node, which is the
only node with methods, has a "device_type" which describes
how that package works. This is pretty much standard OBP
stuff.

There's a new version of the spec (0.45) in
the materials directory.

Changes are listed below.

Added "note" to 5.1.1

Made the suggested changes.

Deleted the extra text in "reg". It isn't needed and that also
takes care of the typo and wording there.

Dave and I cleaned that up.

Type 2 isn't supported by this package. Use of type 2 results
in an error.

For type 0 (seek from beginning of device) offset must be zero or
a positive value.

For type 1 (seek relative to current position) offset may be zero,
positive or negative.

This case is now approved for integration into
a minor release of the firmware and a micro release
of the OS. All interfaces are "Sun Private".

The HV APIs have been added to the registry.
