Inception: 2005/116 sunv4 core API
March 7, 2005
===========================================================

Project team issues:

1. API versioning

STATUS: The project team needs to resolve how they are going
to implement API versioning before commitment review. Many of
the issues raised by the FWARC memebers related to this issue.

2. mmu_demap_*
    (use of cpulist)

STATUS: The use of cpulist is not well defined and does not match 
the single 'cpu' arguments in the APS's. This issue needs to be
resolved by the project team before commitment review.

3. memory_scrub
    (definining error boundaries - this one will go to the SWG working group - 
the call convention and errors will not change ... just the normative text on 
behaviour)
4. memory_sync
    same as 3 above.

STATUS: The above two issues need to be resolved by the project team 
before commitment reivew.

3.2. Technical
	Delete NVRAM_READ & NVRAM_WRITE from function number table.
	Delete CPU_WATCHDOG
6.2.4 and 6.2.4.1 Technical
	Delete cpu_watchdog API

STATUS: The above two issues can be closed once the project team has
resubmitted an API specification with the offending sections and table 
entries removed.

6.2.9. Editorial
	CPU_MONDO_SEND is listed as CPU_SEND_MONDO in the
	function number table in 3.2

STATUS: The above issue can be closed once the project team has
resubmitted an API specification with the error corrected.

1.  I think there are some interfaces which are from HV to Guest,
     e.g., traps from HV on errors etc.  Which specification/ARC case
     defines these interfaces?

STATUS: The project team should create a section '1.1' that calls out 
all related FWARC cases. Other FWARC cases that are related to this one 
and producing their own specs may want to leverage this section.

4.  Section 3.2, we probably want to create registry so that new
     API function numbers can be added and are managed via registry.

STATUS: The case owner and intern will work with the project team to 
create a registry of all trap numbers and function numbers used by the 
sun4v API. The registry will state that re-use of function numbers is not 
allowed.

8.  Section 5.1.4, the second last sentence in the description states
     that, "...  real trap table (rtba) entry point on one of the CPUs.
     Is this "one" a typo for "all"?  The description prior to this
     sentence talks about capturing all CPUs etc.
9.  Section 6.1, is the CPU id referred in the CPU list the same as
     the CPUID (interruptable ID)? or the one assigned by HV in the
     cpu_myid?  I think it is the later, right?  Either way, I think
     a description on what is CPU id would be nice in this section.

STATUS: For the previous two issues, the project team needs to elaborate 
on the wording of those sections to anwser the questions. Once that has 
been done, these issues can be closed.

12.  Section 7.1.1, the first sentence is not clear due to spelling
      errors.
13.  Section 7.2, the second table, the last row on the page 16,
      what does "so" stand for in "so page"?  What is "so page"?

STATUS: The project team will work with Hitendra on the wording of 
these two sections. They can be closed once Hitendra approves of 
the new wording.

14.  Section 7.3.6 and 7.3.7, I think the description should also
      mentioned something about the single unified I and D TLBs.
      A description similar to 7.3.8 related to single unified TLB
      is needed for these sections.

STATUS: The project team should have a single introductory statement 
that describes how the mmu flags argument works for those APIs that 
use it. Once the project team completes this and resubmits the API 
spec, this issue can be closed.

15.  Section 7.3.11, I do not understand the second paragraph related
      to avoiding complicated address mapping issues.  What complications
      does this refer to?

STATUS: The project team will fix the wording to clarify 'complications'. 
Issue can be closed once new spec is submitted.


Tony Sumpter

STATUS: Most of Tony's issue were editorial. They can be closed when the 
project team resubmits the updated specification. For non-editorial issues, their 
status is explicitly mentioned below.

Issues - FWARC/2005/116 sun4v core API
() refs to api.pdf Rev 0.16 dated March 4, 2005

1.
(2.) "0x80 and above" -> "0x80 to 0xff inclusive"
     "faster form" -> "hyper-fast form"
(2.1) "instruction semantics" -> "function semantics"
(2.2) "instruction semantics" -> "function semantics"

2.
(2.1) Need to clarify whether all of %o0 through %o4 are always volatile
or only the ones explicitly used by the function.
Need to clarify if return status is always set.

STATUS: Tony will work off-line with the project team to find a way to 
clarify the above issue that satisfies both parties.

3.
(2.1) Need to clarify if further arguments in memory are allowed or not
with hyper-fast traps. 

3.
(2.2) Need to clarify whether all of %o0 through %o4 are always volatile
or only the ones explicitly used by the function.
Need to clarify which outputs are always set.
Need to clarify %o5 output.
Need to clarify if return status is always set.

4.
(2.3) "any additional result value being returned in %o1" is
inconsistent with rest of paragraph and preceding tables.

6.
(3.1) Need to say something about 0x86 through 0xfe.

7.
(3.2) Need to specify how many bits in %o5 the function number is.
Need to say something about the numbers which are not listed.

8.
(3.3) Need to specify how many bits in the return status are significant.
Need to say something about the numbers which are not listed.

9.
(4.) Machine description will be required for completeness.

10.
(?) Relationship to the sun4v architecture spec (or SunSPARC 2.0)
needs to be noted.

11.
(5.) For all API entries, the number of bits in each argument
that are significant needs to be stated. [PRM style bit layouts
might be appropriate.]

12.
(5.) A more rigorous enumeration of domain state is required. These
states to be related to the sun4v architecure spec.

13.
(5.1.2) "service processor" is not defined in the document.

STATUS: Tony will work off-line with the project team to resolve this 
issue. It can be closed per approval of Tony.

14.
(5.1.2) Need a description of exit_code values somewhere which includes
unrequested exits.

15.
(5.1.3) No algorithm for determining the complete size of the machine
description is given.

16.
(5.1.4) An exact description of the state after SIR needs to be provided
as part of the resolution to issue 12 above. Eg register states.

17.
(5.1.4) What happens if the processor cannot support SIR?

18.
(6.) A more rigorous enumeration of CPU state is required.

19.
(6.2.1) What is the state of %npc, %pstate, etc.?

20.
(6.2.2) "running state" is not mentioned in (6.)
