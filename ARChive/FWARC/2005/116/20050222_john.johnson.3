2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
   
	This case is a part of the sun4v umbrella case
	FWARC/2004/510.

	This case defines the core CPU and memory API for sun4v.
	
	These APIs present abstractions to guest FW (such as OBP)
	and OS (such as solaris) SW in several core areas.  The
	main areas covered by this API are:

	- CPU management

	- MMU management

	- virtual machine management

	- virtual console and TOD devices

4. Technical Description:

   4.1 Overview

	See FWARC/2004/510 for overview.

	This case defines the core APIs for a sun4v guest.
	They allow the guest to manipulate its virtual
	machine without knowledge of the underlying HW
	implementation.

	These APIs will be implemented by a firmware layer
	called a hypervisor, which is delivered with the
	HW platform.

	The main direct consumer of these APIs will be the
	platform FW (OBP).  Solaris will also use them both
	directly and indirectly through OBP client interfaces.

	These APIs will not be visible to user SW, and should
	require no changes to ABI compliant applications.
