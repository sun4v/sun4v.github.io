2. Project Summary

        This document describes how the Physical Resource Inventory (PRI) can be
        used to enumerate disks in systems where multipathing is enabled.

3. Business Summary

        On previous platforms, firmware was able to correctly determine
        what the future path of a disk would be under Solaris using a
        combination of the pci path to the hba and the phy number at 
        which the bay and hba attached.  The FMA disk enumerator in the OS
        then cross-referenced these paths in order to obtain the nac
        names of the bays, and later to inform the user of the
        physical location of disks in the system.  With multipathing
        enabled the pci-path and phy number are abstracted by Solaris
        and replaced by the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) of the
        disk.  Rather than create a bogus path for Solaris to parse,
        firmware should provide the same information as it did before, 
        but in a more generic form.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

       The component nodes that represent directly connected disks and their
       respective controllers will be updated in the following way.

       Representation of a directly attached disk will require at least two
       component nodes:

	1) A new component node which represents the Host Bus Adapter (hba) 
	   controller where topo-hc-name = "hba".

	2) A component node which represents the physical slot (bay) where a
	   disk would connect to, where topo-hc-name = "bay".


	Since disk drives can be hot-swapped, there is no way to
	deterministically depict any and all possible disk drives; thus the 
	representation of directly attached disks will terminate at the disk 
	bay.

     4.1.1 topo-hc-name = "hba"

	A new component node that represents a (SCSI) Host Bus Adapter which
	contains ports that disk drives can be connected to. Properties required
	of the hba node include:

	   type = "io";
	   topo-hc-name = "hba";
	   id = ID#;
	   nac = "<NAC STRING>";
	   path = "<HBA PCI PATH>";


     4.1.2 phy_number

       Name		Tag		Required
        ----		---		--------
        phy_number	PROP_DATA	no

         Description
         -----------
         An array of 8 bit values that specifies how the represented drive bay is
         physically attached to an hba or set of hbas.  The values are relatively
         indexed by the id properties in node parents with topo-hc-name="hba".

           phy_number[0] = PHY connection to hba with the lowest id property
           phy_number[1] = PHY connection to hba with the next lowest id property
           etc..

         This property is required for topo-hc-name="bay" component nodes
         directly attached to a controller that may invoke multipathing.

       Example md nodes:

         Bay connected to a single hba:
         -----------------------------

          +--------+         +-------+
          |   hba  | phy = 6 |  bay  |
          | id = 1 |---------|       |            
          +--------+         +-------+       


          node component hba1 {
	       topo-hc-name = "hba";
	       id = 1;
               fwd -> bay
          }

          node component bay {
	       back -> hba1;
	       topo-hc-name = "bay";
	       phy_number = [ 6 ];
          }


         Bay connected to multiple hbas:
         ------------------------------

          +--------+
          |   hba  | phy = 3 +-------+
          | id = 0 |---------|       |            
          +--------+         |  bay  |
                             |       |
          +--------+ phy = 7 |       |
          |   hba  |---------|       |
          | id = 4 |         +-------+  
          +--------+

          node component hba0 {
	       topo-hc-name = "hba";
	       id = 0;
               fwd -> bay
          }

          node component hba4 {
	       topo-hc-name = "hba";
	       id = 4;
               fwd -> bay
          }

          node component bay {
	       back -> hba0;
	       back -> hba4;
	       topo-hc-name = "bay";
	       phy_number = [ 3 7 ];
          }
