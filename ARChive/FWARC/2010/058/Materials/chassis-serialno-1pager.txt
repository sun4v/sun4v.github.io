2. Project Summary

2.1 Project Description

	This project adds a new message to the Logical Domains Agents
	framework service 'agent-system', as defined in FWARC 2009/426.

	The Chassis Serial Number is needed to support PSARC 2010/004
	"Virtual Information API and virtinfo program", which specifies
	the display of the "Chassis Serial Number".

2.2 Risks and Assumptions

	None.

3. Business Summary

3.1 Problem Area

	The Chassis Serial Number on a sun4v LDoms system is only
	available in the PRI of the control domain.  This information
	is needed in the guest domains.  A message needs to be added
	to the ldmad 'agent-system' domain service to provide
	Chassis Serial Number from the control domain.

3.2 Market/Requestor

	See FWARC 2005/633.

3.3 Business Justification

	See FWARC 2005/633.

3.4 Competitive Analysis

	See FWARC 2005/633.

3.5 Opportunity Window/Exposure

	See FWARC 2005/633.

3.6 How will you know when you are done?

	See FWARC 2005/633.

4. Technical Description

4.1 Overview

	The Chassis Serial Number Message will be added to the definition
	of the Logical Domains Agent 'agent-system' domain service defined
	in FWARC 2009/426.

	The agent and its messages are described in the updated "Logical
	Domain Agents Specification" document, provided as part of this case.

4.2 Bug/RFE Number(s)

	6680702 Want a mechanism for Solaris to know if it is an LDOM and if so what type
	6712763 Need information about control domain from within a guest domain

4.3 Scope

	Not Applicable.

4.4 Out of Scope

	Not Applicable.

4.5 Interfaces

	4.5.1 Interfaces

		The new message is embodied in the format of the
		messages passed between the control domain and the
		different agents.

		For a detailed description of the interface see the
		Logical Domain Agents Specification document.
