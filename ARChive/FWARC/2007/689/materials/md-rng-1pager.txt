2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description: This project introduces changes to the Machine
	Description (MD) tree and the Physical Resource Inventory (PRI) for
	Niagara2 and Victoria Falls based platforms in order to support the
	random number generator (RNG) portion of these chips.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
   	a)      Appropriate changes will be made to VBSC to allow
		incorporation of the RNG nodes specified here into the PRI.
	b) 	Appropriate changes will be made to the LDOM manager to allow
		incorporation of RNG "devices" into Domain MDs, and into the
		Hypervisor MD.  This is necessary to enable both the RNG driver
		within LDOM primary & guest domains, and the Hypervisor itself,
		to support the RNG HV API specified in FWARC/2007/558.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
	Support for RNG access from within Logical Domains.

   3.2. Market/Requester:

   3.3. Business Justification:
	Support for the hardware RNG capability present in the Niagara2 &
	Victoria Falls processors is an important selling point for the
	platforms based on these chips.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
	Built-in access to the hardware RNGs must be maintained at the time
	that the N2 & VF based platforms are released.

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
	When the RNG driver can successfully plug into the Solaris
	Cryptographic Framework from within both primary & guest
	Logical Domains.

	When SunVTS can exercise the full RNG functionality of the underlying
	N2 & VF processors from within the primary & guest LDOM.




4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

	In order to support hardware acceleration via the Random Number
	Generatio (RNG) portion of the N2 & VF chips, the following changes to
	the Machine Description (MD) are proposed.

    4.1.1. cpu node changes:

	Description:
		Augmented to include new optional exec-unit
		subordinate as described below:

	Name:		exec-unit
	Category:	optionally required by cpu
	Required subordinates:	-
	Optional subordinates:	-
	Description:	This node is a type of exec-unit and uniquely
			represents a specific rng definition.  Includes
			references to the physical cpu's which have
			access to the given rng.
	Properties:
	  Name		Tag		Required	Description
	  ----		---		--------	-----------
	  type		PROP_DATA	yes		The string "rng"
