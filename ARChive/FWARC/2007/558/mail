This case defines version 2.0 APIs but 1.0 version of APIs are still 
supported as mentioned
above (that HV will emulate the 1.0 API), is this correct?   I see word 
"deprecated" above
in the reference for 2006/481 but do not see any of the interfaces 
deprecated in the interface
table below and hence I want to make sure that nothing is deprecated by 
this case.  This
case simply defines version 2.0 of the APIs.

The original case had RNG_GET_DIAG_CONTROL but I don't see it in this 
case but
I do see following note in section 4,

		Note that the caller must have Diagnostic Control of the RNG in
		order to invoke this operation (see rng_get_diag_control).


There is no section defining rng_get_diag_control in the specification.

This case is "open" but above interfaces are classified as "Sun 
Private".  I know all past
interfaces have been Sun Private too but since now we have decided to 
make all FWARC
cases "open" does it make sense for them to be "private"?  I don't know 
answer to this
question but something to think/discuss about.  Probably, "uncommitted" 
instead of
"Sun Private" is more appropriate.

Any thoughts on this?

The interfaces are not uncommitted. They are Sun Private.

The interface taxonomy is separate from the case being "open".
"open" just means that the case information and materials
can be published externally and they don't contain any proprietary
information, and that has nothing to do with the interface taxonomy.

Joshua will have to respond to your other questions when he
gets back. If the intent is to deprecate the v1.0 interfaces,
they should be in the interface table as v1.0, ..., deprecated.
The HV will continue to emulate the v1.0 interfaces because
drivers and the OS that uses them have already been released.

That reference should probably be to section 1.4 of the document, I guess.
Joshua will fix it when he gets back. diagnostic control is only available
to trusted guests. Basically, any guest can read random numbers, but only
the trusted guest can configure and get diagnostic control of the RNG.

We got rid of RNG_GET_DIAG_CONTROL, and I should have been more careful 
to document why we got rid of it and what takes its place.  Essentially,
there is no need for this API call as the ldoms manager and vBSC 
designate which domain is primary.  Only the primary domain is trusted, 
and it can be the only one that get diagnostic access to the RNGs.  The 
HV maintains a rngaccessible property in the primary domain that marks 
it as capable of using the diagnostic API calls.

We got rid of RNG_GET_DIAG_CONTROL since we don't swap diagnostic 
control around.  Only one domain can have that kind of control and its
access if mitigated by the ldoms manager.

The materials have been updated. The new materials
are in the materials directory, and include the updated
spec and diffs from the previous version.

The updates clarify that the v1.0 interfaces are being
deprecated (including in the interface table) and the
dangling reference to a v1.0 interface was removed.

Some text was added to explain that in both v1.0 and v2.0
only trusted domains can get access to the control and
diag interfaces. v1.0 had an explicit interface for
getting diagnostic control, but that interface wasn't
needed, but it will still be emulated by the new implementation
for old clients that negotiate the v1.0 APIs. Either way,
only the control domain is able to access to the control
and diagnostic interfaces. Any guest can read random
numbers, and that API is unchanged between v1.0 and
v2.0.

I'm extending the timeout 1 day to Oct 3 since the
changes were only clarifications. If anybody needs
more time, let me know.

Sorry for late reply.  I don't need more time and I am fine with the
updated specification.  The only comment I have  is related to
the interfaces classification for deprecated interfaces.  "deprecated"
is not an ARC classification.  We used to have "obsolete" but that
has become a modifier now.  I see followings in,

http://sac.eng/cgi-bin/bp.cgi?NAME=interface_taxonomy.bp


      ====



      Modifiers

Modifiers may prefix a compatibility level to modify its meaning.


*Obsolete*

    The Obsolete modifier indicates an interface that is "deprecated"
    and/or no longer advised for general use. An existing interface may
    be downgraded from some other status (such as Committed or
    Uncommitted) by the application of the Obsolete modifier to
    encourage customers to migrate from that interface before it may be
    removed (or incompatibly changed).

======


I think the classifications for the deprecated interfaces needs to 
change as follows,

    Obsolete Uncommitted

I made the change (manually) to the materials, updated
the trap registry and marked the case as closed approved.
The old file is there as old*

This case is approved as stated.

Thanks for the correction.

Thanks,
David
