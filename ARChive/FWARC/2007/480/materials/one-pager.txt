2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
	Implement new optional Machine Description Cpu node properties
	to advertise processor capabilities and extensions.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
	This proposal assumes other CPUs (including successors to Rock
	such as Rock+ or Rock2) may or may not choose to implement the
	properties.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
        Processor-specific information should be captured in the Machine
        Description.  It should not be hard-coded in the kernel CPU
        module, or anywhere else in the guest operating system.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
	Supernova Solaris engineering.

   3.3. Business Justification:
	- Minimize operating system changes required to support new
          processors.
	- Allow users booting with Solaris' "generic sun4v" CPU module
          to take advantage of processor-specific ISA extentions and
          other capabilities.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
	[ redacted ]

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
	The project will be done when the properties are implemented
        according to specification, and the Solaris generic sun4v CPU
        module can be booted on Rock, and support the Weak Consistency
        memory model, and ISA extensions such as Transactional Memory.

4. Technical Description:

   4.1 Overview

        The Machine Description Cpu node currently contains a Mandatory
        "isalist" property which contains a "list of the instruction set
        architectures supported by this virtual CPU."

        There are other CPU instruction set features which should be
        captured by the MD.  These are the instruction set extensions
        and the memory models supported by the CPU.

        Currently, the existence of these features have to be hard-coded
        by the guest (e.g., in the Solaris kernel CPU module), which
        presents some maintenance issues.

        More importantly, when the customer configures the system for
        generic sun4v operation (i.e., when the "sun4v" kernel CPU is
        used in Solaris), userland applications lose access to these
        performance features.  With the MD changes described herein,
        this can be avoided.


   4.1.1  Cpu node

        The following optional properties will be added to the Cpu node
        to inform the guest about underlying CPU features.  That is,
        these are updates to Hypervisor API specification, section
        8.13.3.1.

       case where each of them was defined:

         PSARC 2004/797 Processor specific platform libraries
       In the longer-term, we are working with the owner of
       UltraSPARC Architecture, to get the valid HWCAP values
       listed in that document.
