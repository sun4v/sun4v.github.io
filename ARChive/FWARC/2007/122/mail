I am sponsoring this self-review case for Eric Sharakan.  This case
amends the VIO MD nodes as defined in FWARC/2006/072.

This case will be approved for minor/micro/patch OS binding and
minor/micro binding for the firmware

All of the changes are highlighted in the updated document which
can be found at,

http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/arc/FWARC/2007/122/materials/vio-md-nodes-v3.pdf

The brief description of the changes are,


1.  Section 5.1.3, virtual-device class table (channel devices).

     Add following three rows/entries.


   Service  Class   compatible                 device-type  name
   Group
   =========================================================================

    Serial  Client   SUNW,sun4v-channel            serial virtual-channel-
                                                          client
    Serial  Server   SUNW,sun4v-data-plane-channel serial virtual-data-plane-
                                                          channel
    Serial  Client   SUNW,sun4v-data-plane-channel serial virtual-data-plane-
                                                          channel-client


Notes: the virtual-channel-client was missing from the earlier version of
        the document.  It should have been there in the first place.  This
        case corrects that.

        virtual-data-plane-channel and virtual-data-plane-channel-client are
        needed to support Netra products.  These products rely on the
        low-level channel services, but have different driver implementation
        and loading needs.  They also have both Solaris and non-Solaris
        drivers (one for each end of the channel) on these platforms.


2. Section 5.1.4, Device class specific properties table

    Add followings.


    Name                   Tag       Required  Description

    vds-block-device-opts  PROP_DATA no        An array of string names
                                               identifying the options for
                                               the device used by a vds-port
                                               in SUNW,sun4v-disk-server
                                               device. Current valid options
                                               are:

                                               and exported by vds as a
                                               read-only device

                                               “slice” - The device is
                                               exported by vds as a disk

                                                or
                                         SUNW,sun4v-data-plane-channel-client
                                                is providing over this port


3.  Section 5.1.4, virtual-device-port class table

     Added a column to describe the name of parent virtual-device node
     for clarity.


     And add followings.

    Service  Group   Class name    name of parent virtual-device node

    Serial   Client  vldc-port     virtual-channel-client
    Serial   Server  vdpc-port     virtual-data-plane-channel
    Serial   Client  vdpc-port     virtual-data-plane-channel-client
