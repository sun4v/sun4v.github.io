I am sponsoring this case for Kevin Rathbun as a self-review case.
This case adds a domain service very much similar to how we have added
other services such as PRI, ASR, etc.  One-pager with technical changes
in section 4 is attached.

This case introduces a domain service to support host to SC communicates
using the snmp protocol.  It defines service id "snmp" and 3 message types
that go along.

The changes are approved for minor/micro/patch OS binding and
minor/micro binding for the firmware.


Thanks.

2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

        This case describes the domain service interface through which a 
        client communicates with the SC using the snmp protocol. This will
	be used by PICL on sun4v platforms, beginning with Huron, to access
	environmental fru data and other information which will be used to
	populate the /physical-platform tree. This information can be
	dynamically updated and is accessible to user commands such as 
	prtpicl and prtdiag.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        If this feature is not available in time for the full software stack
        to be tested then it risks missing s10u4 and hence Huron RR. This 
        would be a significant customer dissatisfier and is already an
        escalation on Ontario.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

        This project proposes an interface to support the snmp protocol
        over a domain service channel.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Ontario/Huron/Maramba platforms, means to satisfy key requirement for
        PICL.

   3.3. Business Justification:

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Solaris s10u4

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into both Solaris Nevada
        and S10u4, and into the Huron firmware gate for vbsc.

4. Technical Description:

    4.1 Overview

	Each of the SNMP Messages consists of a header and a payload.
	The headers are defined by this specification and the payloads
	consist of data encoded according to the SNMP protocol, as defined
	by a number of IETF RFC's. The SNMP protocol versions supported
	and their message formats are not part of this specification. The
	version support is negotiated between the domain ds_snmp driver
	and the SNMP Agent resident on the SC. The SNMP PDUs are simply
	encapsulated by the SNMP Domain Service that is the subject of
	this specification. The length of the SNMP PDU is encoded in the
	message itself and is not part of the header. It is left to the
	consumers at the endpoints on this domain service to send and
	receive and detect properly formed SNMP messages.

    4.1.2 SNMP domain service 1.0

        The version of the domain service described below is 1.0.
    
    4.1.2.1 Service ID

        The following service ID should be added to the Domain Services
        registry for the SNMP service capabilities.

        Service ID                Description
        ----------                ----------------------------------
        "snmp"                     SNMP domain service

    4.1.2.2 Message Header Formats

        All SNMP Messages have the same header format consisting of a
        Message Number and a Message Type.

        The Message Number is a monotonically increasing number that uniquely 
        identifies each message. Responses to messages are expected to use 
        the same message number so that they can be paired with their original 
        message. The Message Number may also be used to distinguish between
        multiple instances of the same message type.

        New messages may be issued without waiting for a response to a
        preceding message.  The underlying transport protocol is responsible
        to ensure reliable, in-order and unduplicated message packets.

        Messages are to be processed in the order received.

        The Message Type is used to distinguish the different message types.
        There are three types defined in this initial version of the protocol
        specification.

        Offset Size   Field name
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type

        Message Type  Value
        ------------  -----
        Request       0
        Reply         1
        Error         2

    4.1.2.3 SNMP Request Message

        An SNMP Request Message is sent by the client carrying a payload to
        be delivered to the snmp agent.

        The Message Number value will be used in the SNMP Reply Message
        sent in response to this request.

        The Message Type field should indicate an SNMP Request Message.

        The payload field has variable length depending on the snmp data.

        Offset Size   Field
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
        16      Var   payload

    4.1.2.4 SNMP Reply Message

        An SNMP Reply Message is sent by the server in response to a request
	from the client. It carries a payload whose content is determined
	by the snmp agent acting on the request.

        The Message Number field contains the value in the Message Number field
        of the request being serviced.

        The Message Type field should indicate an SNMP Reply Message.

        The payload field has variable length depending on the snmp data.

        Offset Size   Field
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
        16      Var   payload

    4.1.2.5 SNMP Error Message

        An SNMP Error Message is sent by the server in response to a request
	from the client that cannot be serviced. These include errors such as
	being unable to contact the SNMP Agent or timing out waiting for a 
	reply from the SNMP agent. It has no payload.

        The Message Number field contains the value in the Message Number field
        of the request that could not be serviced.

        The Message Type field should indicate an SNMP Error Message.

        Offset Size   Field
        ------ ----   ----------
        0       8     Message Number
        8       8     Message Type
