4. Technical Description

4.1 Overview - System Information domain service 1.0

The System Information capability provides for the ability to query
various system information, such as POSIX utsname strings.  It is
anticipated that this service may be expanded as needed in the future
to support such areas as, for example, Solaris sysinfo and Solaris kstat's.

4.1.1 Service IDs

There is one service ID defined to support System Information queries.

	Service ID		Description
	----------		-----------
	"system-info"		Guest system system information queries

4.1.2 Message Header

	Offset	Size	Field name	Description
	------	----	----------	-----------
	0	4	cmd		Command

4.1.3 Message types

The following constants are defined for System Information domain service
command identifier values:

	Type			Value	Definition
	----			-----	----------
	SYS_INFO_GET_REQ	0x0	Request getting system information.
	SYS_INFO_GET_RESP	0x1	Response to a get information request.

4.1.4 Get Information Payload

The Get Information header is followed by a variable number of NUL
terminated strings.  Each string represents a specific piece of system
information to return.  The following are the supported strings:

	System Info Datum Name	Description
	----------------------	-----------
	"uts-sysname"		utsname.sysname
	"uts-nodename"		utsname.nodename
	"uts-release"		utsname.release
	"uts-version"		utsname.version
	"uts-machine"		utsname.machine

Note that the string values returned should be identical to what is
provided by the POSIX uname user command.  Non-POSIX compliant guest
systems may choose to support any of these items if they are appropriate.

4.1.5 Get Information Response Payload

Response to the Get Information request is a message with the Get Information
header followed by the following response payload.  In the event that no
Datum Names were identified, the result field will be SYS_INFO_INVALID_NAME
and the num_pairs field will be zero.  If multiple Datum names were provided
and not all of them were matched, the result field will be SYS_INFO_SUCCESS
and the number of Datum names matched will be in the num_pairs field and their
corresponding name/value pairs will be in the name/value fields.  Each datum
name and datum value will be a NUL terminated string.

	Offset	Size	Field Name	Description
	------	----	----------	-----------
	0	4	result		Result of Operation
	4       4	num_pairs	Number of name/value pairs returned.
	8	Var	name1		Name of first datum
	Var	Var	value1		Value of first datum
	Var	Var	name2		Name of second datum
	Var	Var	value2		Value of second datum
	...

4.1.6 Response Result Codes

The result field in the response payload details the results of the requested
operation.  The result codes are defined as follows:

	Name			Value	Definition
	----			-----	----------
	SYS_INFO_SUCCESS	0x0	Operation succeeded
	SYS_INFO_INVALID_NAME	0x1	No valid datum name supplied
