2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
   
        This project updates the machine description iodevice nodes
        originally defined in case 2007/070. While implementing the
        properties described in that case, certain problems were
        encountered which the updates presented in this case attempt
        to solve.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
   
        The proposed changes will constitute a flag day between
        reset/config and OpenBoot. This is not a difficult problem
        since the two components are released as part of the same
        consolidation.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
   
        The reasoning behind the creation of these iodevice MD nodes
        is beyond the scope of this case (interested parties can
        refer to the material in the original FWARC case [1]). The
        problem being addressed is that while implementing the
        interfaces defined in that case, certain problems were
        encountered which require tweaking some of the approved
        interfaces. The problems which are being solved are presented
        in this section.

     3.1.1 slot-names

        The 'slot-names' property as defined in the original case
        consisted of a single PROP_STR data type, however, the
        'slot-names' property as defined in [2] consists of an encoded
        integer followed by encoded string(s). The encoded integer
        is a bitmask of available devices as described in [6]. This case
        proposes to fix this problem by modifying the PCI slot MD
        device properties so that instead of having a 'slot-names'
        property the PCI slot MD node can have multiple forward links
        to 'slot-name' MD nodes. Then each 'slot-name' MD node can have
        two properties; one of type PROP_STR which describes one of the
        strings that OpenBoot is to encode and the other of type PROP_VAL
        which describes the associated available device number. OpenBoot can
        glean the integer that is to be encoded by assembling a bitmask
        based on the device numbers.

     3.1.2 devaliases

        In the original case, any iodevice could have a single
        property named 'devalias' of type PROP_STR. However, it's
        possible for a single iodevice node to have multiple device
        aliases pointing to it (for example, 'net' and 'net0' often
        point to the same actual device path). To allow this to work,
        this case is proposing that any iodevice node can have forward
        links to devalias nodes which contain a 'devalias' property of
        type PROP_STR and a 'path' property also of type PROP_STR. Then
        OpenBoot can parse all forward links and create a devalias entry
        for each node that it finds.

     3.1.3 level1-hotplug-slot-count and level2-hotplug-slot-count

        FWARC case 2006/198 (PCI Hotplug Resource Preallocation) [4]
        defines two properties 'level1-hotplug-slot-count' and
        'level2-hotplug-slot-count' which are hardware-topology dependent.
        As such, OpenBoot will have to extract this information from the
        MDs. This case proposes adding two new optional properties of
        type PROP_VAL to pass this information along to the guest OpenBoot.

     3.1.4 hotplug-supported

        The method by which OpenBoot allocates and retains PCI resources
        during nexus probe varies based on whether or not a platform
        supports PCI hotplug in any of its slots. Currently, this is
        determined by a compile time switch, although it is desired to
        modify the behavior at run time so that the same OpenBoot binary
        can be used across all platforms. In order to make this check
        dynamic, we are adding a property 'hotplug-supported' to the MD,
        and OpenBoot can modify it's behavior based on the property's
        presence.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
   
        OpenBoot and VBSC firmware teams

   3.3. Business Justification:
   
        These changes allow future OpenBoot images to operate unmodified on
        multiple platforms, thereby drastically decreasing OpenBoot development
        time.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
   
        N/A

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

        Project team is attempting to make changes available in time for Huron
        RR

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
      
        When code has been integrated into released system firmware image.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

        The updated technical description of the iodevice nodes can be
        found in the case materials directory [5]. The list of changes
        from the previous version are listed here.

    4.1.1 Slot name change

        The case removes the 'slot-name' property from the available
        properties for PCI slot device properties. A section defining
        the new slot name node is being added.

    4.1.2 devalias change

        The case removes the 'devalias' property from the available
        properties for PCI slot device properties. A section defining
        the new devalias node is being added.

    4.1.3 level1-hotplug-slot-count and level2-hotplug-slot-count change

        The case defines the new optional properties
        'level1-hotplug-slot-count' and 'level2-hotplug-slot-count'
        for Sun4v to PCI Express root nexus device  MD nodes.

    4.1.4 hotplug-supported

        The case defines the new optional property 'hotplug-supported'
        for PCI slot device MD nodes.

    4.2. Bug/RFE Number(s):

        N/A
   
    4.3. In Scope:
   
        Changes to the MD iodevice node definitions

    4.4. Out of Scope:
