4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

        This project defines new MD nodes to represent on board hardware IO 
        devices. OpenBoot will use these nodes during IO device probing to 
        determine which devices are present and need to be probed. The device 
        nodes in the machine description will also contain hardware-specific 
        properties that OpenBoot requires in order to create various device 
        tree properties.

        The new MD nodes and their properties are described below. To help 
        illustrate what this case is trying to accomplish, the materials 
        directory contains a small sample device tree [3], what the MD source 
        file would look like for this IO topology [4], and a PDF file to help 
        drive the concept home [5].

        This case is attempting to solve problems that were also described in 
        previous FWARC cases that concentrated on the MAC addresses [1] and 
        interrupt-maps [2]. However, the solutions presented in those cases did
        not fully solve all of the IO topolgy problems, and they were 
        unpalatable to the ldoms manager team since they did not cleanly fit 
        into the MD lint cleanup protocol (the MD lint cleanup protocol is how 
        the ldoms manager controls domain to IO device association). Approval
        of this case will cause those cases to be withdrawn.        

        The MD iodevice tree is not meant to replace ASR database functionality. 
        If a device is disabled in the ASR database, it's node will still appear 
        in the MD, which means that OpenBoot will still have to check if a device 
        is disabled before probing it.

    4.1.2 Interrupt mapping node

        Name:                   interrupt-map-entry
        Category:               optional
        Required subordinates:  -
        Optional subordinates:  -

        Description:

        This node describes a hardware interrupt mapping from a child
        device interrupt domain to a parent device interrupt domain. I/O
        device nodes may have forward links to these interrupt mapping nodes.
        Each node will correspond to a line in the device tree 'interrupt-map'
        property. For more information about the 'interrupt-map' related 
        properties, please refer to [6].

        As stated in the description of 'parent-device-path' below, if OpenBoot 
        cannot find the parent interrupt device in the device tree, OpenBoot 
        must eliminate the device tree node corresponding to the iodevice node 
        which has the forward arc to the associated interrupt-map-entry node. 
        The reason for this is that interrupt mappings cannot span accross 
        multiple domains, so a child interrupt domain must be within the same 
        logical domain as the parent interrupt domain. To avoid forcing 
        restrictions on the device probing order, we will have to overlay 
        interrupt map properties after all devices have been probed.

                                      is specified by the 'parent-device-path'
                                      property is not present in the device
