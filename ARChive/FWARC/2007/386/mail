I am sponsoring the FWARC case as a fast track for myself. The case 
updates the machine description iodevice nodes to fix certain problems 
which were made obvious during the implementation of the original case.

The interfaces can be released in a micro/minor version of the firmware.

Since many people are on vacation next week, I'm extending the timer to 
07/10/2007

2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
  
        This project updates the machine description iodevice nodes
        originally defined in case 2007/070. While implementing the
        properties described in that case, certain problems were
        encountered which the updates presented in this case attempt
        to solve.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
  
        The proposed changes will constitute a flag day between
        reset/config and OpenBoot. This is not a difficult problem
        since the two components are released as part of the same
        consolidation.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
  
        The reasoning behind the creation of these iodevice MD nodes
        is beyond the scope of this case (interested parties can
        refer to the material in the original FWARC case [1]). The
        problem being addressed is that while implementing the
        interfaces defined in that case, certain problems were
        encountered which require tweaking some of the approved
        interfaces. The problems which are being solved are presented
        in this section.

     3.1.1 slot-names

        The 'slot-names' property as defined in the original case
        consisted of a single PROP_STR data type, however, the
        'slot-names' property as defined in [2] consists of an encoded
        integer followed by encoded string(s). The encoded integer
        is the number of encoded strings which follow. This case
        proposes to fix this problem by modifying the PCI slot MD
        device properties so that instead of having a 'slot-names'
        property the PCI slot MD node can have multiple forward links
        to 'slot-name' MD nodes. Then each 'slot-name' MD node can have
        a single property of type PROP_STR which describes one of the
        strings that OpenBoot is to encode. OpenBoot can glean the
        integer that is to be encoded by counting the number of forward
        links

     3.1.2 devaliases

        In the original case, any iodevice could have a single
        property named 'devalias' of type PROP_STR. However, it's
        possible for a single iodevice node to have multiple device
        aliases pointing to it (for example, 'net' and 'net0' often
        point to the same actual device path). To allow this to work,
        this case is proposing that any iodevice node can have forward
        links to devalias nodes which contain a single 'devalias'
        property of type PROP_STR. Then OpenBoot can parse all forward
        links and create a devalias entry for each node that it finds.
        This is similar to the mechanism proposed for the virtual-device
        nodes in [3].

     3.1.3 level1-hotplug-slot-count and level2-hotplug-slot-count

        FWARC case 2006/198 (PCI Hotplug Resource Preallocation) [4]
        defines two properties 'level1-hotplug-slot-count' and
        'level2-hotplug-slot-count' which are hardware-topology dependent.
        As such, OpenBoot will have to extract this information from the
        MDs. This case proposes adding two new optional properties of
        type PROP_VAL to pass this information along to the guest OpenBoot.

     3.1.4 hotplug-supported

        The method by which OpenBoot allocates and retains PCI resources
        during nexus probe varies based on whether or not a platform
        supports PCI hotplug in any of its slots. Currently, this is
        determined by a compile time switch, although it is desired to
        modify the behavior at run time so that the same OpenBoot binary
        can be used across all platforms. In order to make this check
        dynamic, we are adding a property 'hotplug-supported' to the MD,
        and OpenBoot can modify it's behavior based on the property's
        presence.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
  
        OpenBoot and VBSC firmware teams

   3.3. Business Justification:
  
        These changes allow future OpenBoot images to operate unmodified on
        multiple platforms, thereby drastically decreasing OpenBoot 
development
        time.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
  
        N/A

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

        Project team is attempting to make changes available in time for 
Huron
        RR

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
     
        When code has been integrated into released system firmware image.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

        The updated technical description of the iodevice nodes can be
        found in the case materials directory [5]. The list of changes
        from the previous version are listed here.

    4.1.1 Slot name change

        The case removes the 'slot-name' property from the available
        properties for PCI slot device properties. A section defining
        the new slot name node is being added.

    4.1.2 devalias change

        The case removes the 'devalias' property from the available
        properties for PCI slot device properties. A section defining
        the new devalias node is being added.

    4.1.3 level1-hotplug-slot-count and level2-hotplug-slot-count change

        The case defines the new optional properties
        'level1-hotplug-slot-count' and 'level2-hotplug-slot-count'
        for Sun4v to PCI Express root nexus device  MD nodes.

    4.1.4 hotplug-supported

        The case defines the new optional property 'hotplug-supported'
        for Sun4v to PCI Express root nexus device  MD nodes.

    4.2. Bug/RFE Number(s):

        N/A
  
    4.3. In Scope:
  
        Changes to the MD iodevice node definitions

    4.4. Out of Scope:

        Properties and MD nodes that are not being modified.

FWARC/2007/288 defined two new "phy-type" property values:
    "xgsd" 10G SerDes
    "gsd" 1G SerDes
Should we include those in the list in section 4.1.1.5?

Section 4.1.1.4 - If "slot-present" property is present in a bridge, is 
it mandatory for that bridge node to have "slot-name" child node? Can we 
clarify this in the spec?

Regards,
Sunit

Based on feedback from Eduardo, I've updated the case materials so that 
the 'hotplug-capable' flag is now a property in the PCI slot iodevice 
nodes as opposed to the root nexus PCI node, and the 'slot-name' 
iodevice nodes have the associated PCI device number as well as the 
string (which is required to assemble the bitmask as described in the 
PCI bus binding).

Technically, that case should have done it, but I've added them to the 
new version so the list is complete moving forward.

No, 'slot-name' is an optional node. Some platforms have not implemented 
the 'slot-names' properties. I've added text in the node description to 
highlight this.

I believe the Solaris hotplug code is dependent on the presence 
"slot-name" or "physical-slot#" property to perform any hotplug 
operation. Do we support PCI hotplug on sun4v machines?

I had to update the definition of the 'devalias' MD node to include a 
second property which explicitly states what the device path is. This is 
because certain IO devices don't have MD nodes (USB devices for example) 
and also because certain devaliases have colon arguments (like the cdrom 
for example).

Steve, I have one comment, see below:

Actually, [3] describes having multiple 'devalias' properties in the  
same virtual-device node, not included in fwd linked nodes.  Any  
reason why we should do it any differently for the iodevice node?

Actually^2, the only discussion regarding multiple 'devalias'  
properties in [3] (FWARC/2007/222) is contained in the directory  
named materials-old.  If having multiple 'devalias' properties in the  
virtual-device node is meant to be part of the approved case, the one- 
pager.txt file presumably needs to be moved.

I'm missing something obvious here: if an IO device doesn't have an  
MD node, where would the devalias subordinate node go?

Good question. The devalias subordinate would be a fwd link from the 
iodevice node that is the closest parent in the device path hierarchy.

For example if we needed to add devaliases for the following two nodes:

/pci@0/network@2
/pci@0/usb@3/cdrom@0

Then the MD would look something like this:

iodevice (pci@0) -> iodevice (network@2) -> devalias (net)
iodevice (pci@0) -> iodevice (usb@3) -> devalias (cdrom)

There is no iodevice node for the cdrom, so the devalias is a child of 
the usb iodevice. Since we can't partition the USB, the devalias would 
still follow the proper domain.

I'm okay with this approach.  Once LDoms starts supporting allocation  
of individual PCI leaf devices to domains, any device we would so  
allocate will need to be represented with its own node in the MD anyway.

Would it be appropriate to clarify the case materials with this info?

Two reasons:

1. Virtual-devices are unique from iodevice MD nodes since with 
virtual-device nodes there is a one-to-one correlation between MD nodes 
and device tree nodes, whereas that may not be the case with iodevice MD 
nodes and device tree nodes (I think I addressed this in the previous 
mail I sent).

2. devaliases for non-virtual-device nodes can have extra arguments (for 
example, a ':f' is appended to the end of the cdrom device tree path).

You are correct that this is no longer similar to the case pointed to by 
[3], so I've updated the onepager accordingly.

Why? Nothing in this case precludes it as far
as I can tell, and I would imagine that many
things will change for that project and that
project will have cases of its own.

Yes you did, and as I said in response, I'm okay with this approach.

Great; thanks.  I have no other issues with this case.

Sorry, the above was very poorly written.  I meant do we need to  
document in the case materials the handling of the devalias nodes  
when there is no corresponding immediate parent corresponding to the  
device in question.  I'm satisfied with Steve's subsequent comment to  
me that the example is captured in the email record.  The issue is  
closed as far as I'm concerned.

-Eric
