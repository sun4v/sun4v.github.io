I'm sponsoring this FWARC Case for myself. I'd like to schedule an 
inception review for 2/12/2007.

Since I'm both the sponsor and the submitter, an intern volunteer would 
be nice.

1. What specifically is the proposal that we are reviewing?

     This proposal represents a migration of hardware-specific data from
     OpenBoot to the machine descriptions. The changes can be released 
in a 
     major/minor firmware release version.

2. What is the motivation for it?

     On current sun4v platforms, many pieces of hardware-specific data 
is hard 
     coded in OpenBoot. This hardware-specific data includes:
          - interrupt-map topology
          - MAC address allocation scheme
          - dynamic IO configuration (XAUI vs. on board phy on Maramba)
          - PCI/PCIE slot names

     One of the goals of the sun4v architecture is to make each guest 
domain 
     (and hence OpenBoot) agnostic regarding the underlying hardware. In 
order 
     to accomplish this, all hardware-specific data needs to be 
extracted from 
     the MD. This proposal accomplishes this goal.

3. What is its plan?

     The proposal has been reviewed by key members of the OpenBoot, 
     reset/config, and LDOMS manager teams, and it has been deemed an 
     acceptable solution to the problems outlined in the onepager.

4. Are there related projects in Sun?

     This project is related to the sub-root-nexus IO partitioning 
     functionality that is being designed by the LDOMs team. The way the 
     proposal has been designed allows the LDOMs manager to trim various 
IO 
     devices from a guest, and the currently available MD cleanup routines 
     will still work.

5. What is the technical content of the project?

     The content of the project is the definition of new MD nodes to 
represent 
     on board hardware IO devices. Then modifications to OpenBoot will 
have to 
     use these nodes during IO device probing.

6. How is the project delivered into the system?

     The project is delivered as a major/minor change to the firmware 
(OpenBoot
     and reset/config).

7. What are the project's hardware platform dependencies? Is it expected to
work on all systems (Desktop thru servers)?

     The proposal will work on all sun4v systems.

8. What is its FW operational environment:

     The environment is similar to the current sun4v firmware environment, 
     although OpenBoot will be reading much more information from the MDs.

9. What is its user interface (tty, graphical, leds, sound, etc.)?

     There is no user interface. Ideally, the end user will not notice a 
single
     difference in functionality.

10. What are your project's other external interfaces (exported and
imported)?

     There are no external interfaces

11. What are its other significant internal interfaces (inter-subsystem and
inter-invocation)?

     OpenBoot will now depend on the existence of IO device data in the 
machine
     description

12. Is the interface extensible? How is the interface expected to evolve?

   * How is versioning handled?

     Via the pre-existing MD extraction versioning mechanisms.

     The interface is extensible by defining new IO device-type nodes.

13. How do the interfaces adapt to a changing world?

     The interfaces attempt to make OpenBoot more stable in a changing 
world by
     moving hardware knowledge into the MDs.

14. What internationalization issues are involved? N/A

     [Note that Firmware is currently exempt from the "Big Rules" regarding
     L10N and I18N because it represents a huge design and delivery problem
     beyond the scope of the current architecture. Resolution is TBD.]

15. How will the project contribute (positively or negatively) to "system
load" and "perceived performance":

     There should be no perceived performance effects. If anything, 
performance
     will improve since OpenBoot will not have to probe non-existent 
devices.

16. How does the project deal with failure and recovery?

     Failure of the MD to create the correct IO topology will cause 
incorrect 
     IO device properties.

17. Issues? Please identify the issues which you would like the ARC to
address.

      N/A

18. Security

      There are no major security issues.

19. Database

      N/A

     Materials are in the case directory.

2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
   
        This project defines new MD nodes that describe the static IO 
topology
        to the OpenBoot guest running in a domain. This allows OpenBoot to 
        extract hardware-specific device information (MAC addresses, 
        interrupt-maps, etc.) from the MD, thereby making the guest 
hardware 
        agnostic.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
   
        These changes will constitute a flag day between reset/config, 
        OpenBoot, and the possibly the LDOMs manager.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
   
        The sun4v architecture necessitates that the guest domain (and 
hence 
        OpenBoot) will need to become hardware agnostic. Currently, 
OpenBoot
        hard codes MAC address to device path association, interrupt-map 
to 
        device path association, PCI slot numbering/labeling 
information, and 
        other information that should be instead extracted from the 
machine 
        descriptions.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
   
        The various firmware teams need these changes.

   3.3. Business Justification:
   
        These changes allow future OpenBoot images to operate unmodified 
on 
        multiple platforms, thereby drastically decreasing OpenBoot 
development
        time.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
   
        N/A

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

        Project team is attempting to make changes available in time for 
Huron 
        RR

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
      
        When code has been integrated into released system firmware image.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

        This project defines new MD nodes to represent on board hardware 
IO 
        devices. OpenBoot will use these nodes during IO device probing to 
        determine which devices are present and need to be probed. The 
device 
        nodes in the machine description will also contain 
hardware-specific 
        properties that OpenBoot requires in order to create various 
device 
        tree properties.

        The new MD nodes and their properties are described below. To help 
        illustrate what this case is trying to accomplish, the materials 
        directory contains a small sample device tree [3], what the MD 
source 
        file would look like for this IO topology [4], and a PDF file to 
help 
        drive the concept home [5].

        This case is attempting to solve problems that were also 
described in 
        previous FWARC cases that concentrated on the MAC addresses [1] 
and 
        interrupt-maps [2]. However, the solutions presented in those 
cases did
        not fully solve all of the IO topolgy problems, and they were 
        unpalatable to the ldoms manager team since they did not cleanly 
fit 
        into the MD lint cleanup protocol (the MD lint cleanup protocol 
is how 
        the ldoms manager controls domain to IO device association). 
Approval
        of this case will cause those cases to be withdrawn.

I believe I have sufficiently addressed all of the open issues. The new 
case materials can be found here:

http://sac.eng/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2007/070/commit.materials/

I'd like to schedule a commitment review for 2/26/2007 so we can 
determine if everyone is okay with how I've resolved the issues.

The new onepager is here:

http://sac.eng/Archives/CaseLog/arc/FWARC/2007/070/commit.materials/onepager.txt

Steve

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 1 Open

Hitendra 02/12/2007
     Section, 4.1.1, "interrupt-map-mask" property.  I believe the
     format of this property is derived from some other ARC case. Please
     add a reference and add it to imported interfaces.

Steve 02/12/2007
I've added the document that describes this information as item [6] in 
the references. I've also added a reference to it where the property is 
defined in the MD.


-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 2 closed

Hitendra 02/12/2007
  Section, 4.1.1, "slot-present?", I think this is an optional property
     and hence not required property.  The "required" column should say 
"no".

Steve 02/12/2007
I've made this property optional, and removed the question mark. Instead 
of looking at the boolean value, we will interpret it's presence as the 
slot presence

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 3 closed

Hitendra 02/12/2007
  Section, 4.1.1, "mac-addresses", I have a question on this property.
     Currently, the addresses are fixed based on the device paths.  What
     would happen if one of the device path is disabled or has failed?
     How to make sure the MAC address assigned to each network device
     does not change from one boot to another?

Stephen 02/12/2007
After explanation at the inception review, this issue is closed

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 4 Open

Hitendra 02/12/2007
  Section, 4.1.2, "child-unit-address", by definition it seems like
     this is one--integer value but the example shows three integers.
     Please define format of this property or add reference to a case
     which defines it.

Steve 02/12/2007
Added text to the property description to specify how many integers are 
in this array
-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 5 Open

Hitendra 02/12/2007
  Section, 4.1.2, "parent-device-path", the comments about deleting
     the child node are not clear.  Lets discuss at the meeting.

Steve 02/12/2007
I will mention about probing the nexus fully before applying the 
interrupt maps. Then OpenBoot will have to trim nodes if their 
interrupt-parent property does not exist. I will update the onepager 
with this description.

Steve 02/15/2007
I've added a paragraph to section 4.1.2 explaining how OpenBoot will use 
these interrupt mapping properties

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 6 Closed

Hitendra 02/12/2007
    Since the "interrupt-map-entry" is an optional property, what does
     it mean when it is missing?  How shall OpenBoot deal with that?

Steve  02/12/2007 No interrupt-map-entry node, no need for an interrupt-map

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 7 Open
Sunit 02/12/2007
Dynamic reconfiguration issues Supernova: chasis manager creates PRI. 
How will this work?

Ash: they need to sync with EricS, too.

Steve 02/12/2007 Sunit will talk to the Supernova team and make sure 
they are okay with the proposal. This issue will remain open until we 
get confirmation.

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 8 Open
Ash 02/12/2007 pci-pcix to pci-pci bridge
Ash: Need to have two device-types: pci-pcix and pci-pcie. Otherwise, 
the LDOMs manager will not know which devices can be partitioned or not.

Steve 02-20-2007: I'll update the onepager to represent this. I've 
modified the case to define the following device_types:
         - picex
         - pcie-switch-upstream
         - pcie-switch-downstream
         - pcie-pcix-bridge
         - pcix-pcix-bridge
         - pci-network
         - pci-scsi
         - pci-generic


-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 9 Open
Sunit 02/12/2007
SASWWID? pci-scsi iodevice

Steve 02/12/2007
I will add saswwid and fix the function number in pci-generic example. I 
will add a pci-scsi device with a SAS WWID property

Steve 02/20/2007
I've added 'pci-scsi'.

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 10 Open
Steve 02/12/2007
Root nexus nodes need to be defined. I will add them to the onepager 
since they are not defined anywhere yet.

Steve 02/20/2007
I've added the device_type 'pciex' which represents a root complex PCI 
device (Fire, N2, etc).

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue 11 Closed
Sunit 02/12/2007
If a device is disabled in ASR database, would the iodevice node for 
that device be present in the MD?

Steve 02/12/2007: I'll think about it and come back with a proposal. 
Leaving the issue open for now.

Steve 02/20/2007: No, I don't think it's a good idea to combine the ASR 
database and the iodevice MD node definition. One describes what 
hardware is available to the guest, the other describes what hardware is 
functional to the guest.

All remaining issues with this case have been addressed, and since there 
is no contention I'm converting this case to a fast track to time out 
one week from today.

Issues and IAM files have been updated.

If you want to, I don't think you need to wait the full week,
