2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
   
        This project defines new MD nodes that describe the static IO topology
        to the OpenBoot guest running in a domain. This allows OpenBoot to 
        extract hardware-specific device information (MAC addresses, 
        interrupt-maps, etc.) from the MD, thereby making the guest hardware 
        agnostic.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
   
        These changes will constitute a flag day between reset/config, 
        OpenBoot, and the possibly the LDOMs manager.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
   
        The sun4v architecture necessitates that the guest domain (and hence 
        OpenBoot) will need to become hardware agnostic. Currently, OpenBoot
        hard codes MAC address to device path association, interrupt-map to 
        device path association, PCI slot numbering/labeling information, and 
        other information that should be instead extracted from the machine 
        descriptions.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
   
        The various firmware teams need these changes.

   3.3. Business Justification:
   
        These changes allow future OpenBoot images to operate unmodified on 
        multiple platforms, thereby drastically decreasing OpenBoot development
        time.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
   
        N/A

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

        Project team is attempting to make changes available in time for Huron 
        RR

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
      
        When code has been integrated into released system firmware image.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

        This project defines new MD nodes to represent on board hardware IO 
        devices. OpenBoot will use these nodes during IO device probing to 
        determine which devices are present and need to be probed. The device 
        nodes in the machine description will also contain hardware-specific 
        properties that OpenBoot requires in order to create various device 
        tree properties.

        The new MD nodes and their properties are described below. To help 
        illustrate what this case is trying to accomplish, the materials 
        directory contains a small sample device tree [3], what the MD source 
        file would look like for this IO topology [4], and a PDF file to help 
        drive the concept home [5].

        This case is attempting to solve problems that were also described in 
        previous FWARC cases that concentrated on the MAC addresses [1] and 
        interrupt-maps [2]. However, the solutions presented in those cases did
        not fully solve all of the IO topolgy problems, and they were 
        unpalatable to the ldoms manager team since they did not cleanly fit 
        into the MD lint cleanup protocol (the MD lint cleanup protocol is how 
        the ldoms manager controls domain to IO device association). Approval
        of this case will cause those cases to be withdrawn.        

        The MD iodevice tree is not meant to replace ASR database functionality. 
        If a device is disabled in the ASR database, it's node will still appear 
        in the MD, which means that OpenBoot will still have to check if a device 
        is disabled before probing it.

    4.1.2 Interrupt mapping node

        Name:                   interrupt-map-entry
        Category:               optional
        Required subordinates:  -
        Optional subordinates:  -

        Description:

        This node describes a hardware interrupt mapping from a child
        device interrupt domain to a parent device interrupt domain. I/O
        device nodes may have forward links to these interrupt mapping nodes.
        Each node will correspond to a line in the device tree 'interrupt-map'
        property. For more information about the 'interrupt-map' related 
        properties, please refer to [6].

        As stated in the description of 'parent-device-path' below, if OpenBoot 
        cannot find the parent interrupt device in the device tree, OpenBoot 
        must eliminate the device tree node corresponding to the iodevice node 
        which has the forward arc to the associated interrupt-map-entry node. 
        The reason for this is that interrupt mappings cannot span accross 
        multiple domains, so a child interrupt domain must be within the same 
        logical domain as the parent interrupt domain. To avoid forcing 
        restrictions on the device probing order, we will have to overlay 
        interrupt map properties after all devices have been probed.

                   PROP_DATA   Yes    An array of integers that
                                      describes the interrupt
                                      number in the child
                                      interrupt domain.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        child-unit-address
                   PROP_DATA   Yes    The unit address of the device
                                      that generates the interrupt
                                      in the child interrupt domain. There 
                                      number of integers in this array will be 
                                      equal to the '#address-cells' for the 
                                      child device.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        parent-device-path
                   PROP_STR    Yes    The textual device path of the
                                      device tree node that serves as
                                      the parent domain of the interrupt
                                      mapping. If the parent device that
                                      is specified by the 'parent-device-path'
                                      property is not present in the device
                                      tree, OpenBoot will eliminate the child
                                      device node from the device tree.
