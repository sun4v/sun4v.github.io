2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
   
        This project defines new MD nodes that describe the static IO topology
        to the OpenBoot guest running in a domain. This allows OpenBoot to 
        extract hardware-specific device information (MAC addresses, 
        interrupt-maps, etc.) from the MD, thereby making the guest hardware 
        agnostic.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
   
        These changes will constitute a flag day between reset/config, 
        OpenBoot, and the possibly the LDOMs manager.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
   
        The sun4v architecture necessitates that the guest domain (and hence 
        OpenBoot) will need to become hardware agnostic. Currently, OpenBoot
        hard codes MAC address to device path association, interrupt-map to 
        device path association, PCI slot numbering/labeling information, and 
        other information that should be instead extracted from the machine 
        descriptions.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
   
        The various firmware teams need these changes.

   3.3. Business Justification:
   
        These changes allow future OpenBoot images to operate unmodified on 
        multiple platforms, thereby drastically decreasing OpenBoot development
        time.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
   
        N/A

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

        Project team is attempting to make changes available in time for Huron 
        RR

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
      
        When code has been integrated into released system firmware image.

4. Technical Description:
    4.1. Details:

        This project defines new MD nodes to represent on board hardware IO 
        devices. OpenBoot will use these nodes during IO device probing to 
        determine which devices are present and need to be probed. The device 
        nodes in the machine description will also contain hardware-specific 
        properties that OpenBoot requires in order to create various device 
        tree properties.

        The new MD nodes and their properties are described below. To help 
        illustrate what this case is trying to accomplish, the materials 
        directory contains a small sample device tree [3], what the MD source 
        file would look like for this IO topology [4], and a PDF file to help 
        drive the concept home [5].

        This case is attempting to solve problems that were also described in 
        previous FWARC cases that concentrated on the MAC addresses [1] and 
        interrupt-maps [2]. However, the solutions presented in those cases did
        not fully solve all of the IO topolgy problems, and they were 
        unpalatable to the ldoms manager team since they did not cleanly fit 
        into the MD lint cleanup protocol (the MD lint cleanup protocol is how 
        the ldoms manager controls domain to IO device association). Approval
        of this case will cause those cases to be withdrawn.

                                      property is not present in the device
                                      tree, OpenBoot will eliminate the child
