2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:

	FWARC case 2006/567 introduced new bindings for Niagara
	crypto providers.  There is a conflict between the name
	chosen for N2CP and the Solaris crypto driver.  This case
	is intended to amend that mistake and rename the n2cp
	device name property. The original FWARC materials are
	still valid with the exception of the changes specified
	in section 3.
