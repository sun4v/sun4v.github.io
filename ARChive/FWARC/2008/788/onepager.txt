2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

	This case defines a new domain service to pass various
	host states to vbsc while the host is coming up.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area

        IPMI v1.5 specification defines a new sensor called 
        'System Firmware Progress'. The purpose of this sensor  
        is to model the firmware running on the payload and provide  
        various states to the external management software(e.g ShMM)  
        using standard IPMI event mechanism. The firmware states  
        of interest includes 'Progress', 'Hang' and 'Error' with  
        various sub-states as defined in the specification. 

        In order for the host to communicate this information to 
        vbsc, a new domain service is reqired, which this case 
        attempts to define.

4. Technical Description:

    4.1 Overview

	OpenBoot is required to send progress indicator states to vBSC. VBSC needs 
	these states for Firmware Progress Sensor implementation. 
  
    4.2 Firmware Progress State domain service

	FW Progress State domain will pass progress state from Openboot to vBSC.
	
    
    4.2.1 Service ID
	The service ID for Firmware Progress State domain service is: 

         Service ID                     Description
         ----------                     -----------
         "fw-progress-state"            Primary FW progress state service

    4.2.2 Message Header

         Offset Size Field name Description
         ------ ---- ---------- -----------
           0     4      cmd      Command

    4.2.3 Message types

         The following constants are defined for the Firmware Progress state
         domain service command identifier values:

                Type                    Value      Definition
          --------------------------    -----  ------------------------         
          FWPS_DS_STATE_UPDATE           0x0   FW Progress state update

                                                
         
    4.3    FW Progress State update Message 
   
    4.3.1  FW Progress State Update Payload

         The message header is followed by the following payload:

         Offset Size Field name           Description
         ------ ---- ---------- ------------------------------
          0      4    state               Firmware Progress states


    4.3.1.1  Firmware Progress State definitions
    
    
         Progress State          Value
         ------------------------------------------------    
         Pre OS boot               1
         Boot start                2
    
    
    
        Pre OS boot state indicates that OpenBoot is done with initialization
        and is ready to do Operating system boot.


	 Boot Start state indicates that Operating System booting has started.
	 
	 
	 Note : For Firmware progression sensor design, Pre OS boot state will 
	        be used to signify that OpenBoot has sucessfully finished
	        initialization process and is ready to boot or drop to OK prompt.
	        This will further indicate that there have been no hang during
	        OpenBoot initialization.
