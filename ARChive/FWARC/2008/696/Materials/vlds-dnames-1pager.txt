2. Project Summary

  2.1. Project Description:

	This case is an extension of FWARC/2005/633 "LDoms: Project
	Q Logical Domaining Umbrella (sun4v/hypervisor/LDoms)"
	that is required to support the ds_dom_name_to_hdl and
	ds_dom_hdl_to_name interfaces that are part of
	PSARC/2008/568 Domain Service's Logical Domains (RFE 6689118).

	This case describes two new properties to the machine description
	data for Logical Domains (LDoms). It proposes that the
	property "vlds-domain-name" property be added to the
	"virtual-domain-service" MD node and the "vlds-remote-domain-name"
	property be added to each "vlds-port" MD node.

4. Technical Description:

  4.1 Overview

  4.1.1  Virtual Domain Name properties

   	Following properties will be added to the Machine Description
	"virtual-domain-service" node and "vlds-port" node, respectively,
	to allow for the implementation of the ds_dom_hdl_to_name and
	ds_dom_name_to_hdl interfaces in PSARC/2008/568 Logical Domain's
	Domain Services.
