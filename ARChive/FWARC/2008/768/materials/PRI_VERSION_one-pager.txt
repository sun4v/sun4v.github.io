2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

	This case adds a version number string to the PRI, allowing consumers
	to make appropriate decisions about support and handling based on the
	versions it knows about as compared to the version of the supplied PRI.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

	It is assumed this property will be added coincidentally with the
	introduction of the changes specified by FWARC/2008/300.


3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:

   	Software needs to be able to interpret & intelligently act upon the PRI
	as it is enhanced & updated.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
        Supernova/KT platforms, to allow the PRI & its consumers to evolve,
	in particular to enable platform independent moduled such as the LDom
	Manager to operate correctly across different generations of platforms
	and associated PRI changes.

   3.3. Business Justification:
        

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:
        

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
        Supernova Firmware.

   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
        When the changes are integrated into the vBSC gates.

4. Technical Description:
