2. Project Summary
    2.1. Project Description:
	This project adds a Rock CPU specific API to the hypervisor
	to support Rock's performance counter and sampler capabilities.

    2.2. Risks and Assumptions:
	The project requires Rock Silicon with the relevant features
	working according to the PRM, possibly after the application
	of software workarounds.

3. Business Summary
    3.1. Problem Area:
	The new API is a fundamental tool needed for performance
	analysis on Supernova systems.

    3.2. Market/Requester:
	The users of the API will be engineers responsbile for
	analyzing and tuning performance of the Solaris kernel and
	Solaris based applications on Supernova systems.  The API
	may be useful for performance tuning on 3rd party operating
	systems such as Linux or FreeBSD.

    3.3. Business Justification:
	Maximal possible performance is a key business requirement for
	Supernova systems.  That goal is a practical impossibility
	without tools of this sort to enable analysis and debug.

    3.4. Competitive Analysis:
	N/A

    3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:
	N/A

    3.6. How will you know when you are done?:
	The project is done when the API is implemented as specified
	on hardware that supports the underlying capability.

4. Technical Description:
     4.1. Details:
	The API will add one new Hypervisor API group, RK_PERF.  The
	API group will contain 13 API functions.  A summary of these
	functions is in the "Interfaces" section.

     4.2. Bug/RFE Number(s):
	N/A

     4.3. In Scope:
	N/A

     4.4. Out of Scope:
	N/A

     4.5. Interfaces:
