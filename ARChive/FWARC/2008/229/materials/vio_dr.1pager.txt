2. Project Summary

   2.1. Project Description:

        This project will provide the capability to dynamically add
        or remove virtual I/O devices and services to/from a domain.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        None.

3. Business Summary

   3.1. Problem Area:

        Each domain requires a set of I/O devices for use by the guest
        operating system which will run in that domain.  The initial
        set of devices is specified when the domain is created by the
        LDoms Manager.  Based on time of day, unexpected increase or
        decrease in workloads, etc., the set of devices assigned to a
        particular guest OS may need to change.

        Currently, adding a virtual I/O device to a guest requires a
        "delayed reconfiguration", which implies a reboot of the
        domain.  This is generally undesirable for our users.  This
        project defines a domain service which will allow the control
        domain to dynamically add a virtual device to a domain or
        dynamically remove a device from a domain.  The domain service
        also provides a means to report the result of the operation as
        well to query the status of any virtual device independent of
        a reconfiguration operation.

        Additionally, the domain service protocol will provide
        support to add or remove a new virtual IO server (service)
        to/from a domain.

   3.2. Market/Requestor:

        See FWARC/2005/633.
        
   3.3. Business Justification:

        See FWARC/2005/633.

   3.4. Competitive Analysis:

        All of Sun's competitors providing virtualization solutions
        offer some form of dynamic reconfiguration (DR) for cpus,
        devices and memory.  Sun's customers have indicated that this
        is high on their wish list.  Providing DR capability for I/O
        devices, when combined with a later project to provide DR of
        memory, will remedy this current competitive disadvantage.
        See also FWARC/2005/633.

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure:

        See FWARC/2005/633.
        
   3.6. How will you know when you are done?:

        The work will be completed when the final code changes to
        dynamically add or remove virtual I/O devices are integrated
        into the Solaris NV and Solaris 10 Update gates and the LDoms
        Manager gate.

4. Technical Description

   4.1 Overview

       The Domain Services protocol (FWARC 2006/055) provides the
       means for the LDoms Manager to communicate requests and receive
       responses from existing services which run in domains.  This
       project defines a new Domain Service to allow the LDoms Manager
       to add and remove virtual devices from domains.  On the control
       domain the ldm command line interface already accepts the
       commands required to add or remove devices to/from a guest
       domain.  Currently, however, these commands result in a delayed
       reconfiguration.  When this project is complete, those same
       commands will result in a dynamic reconfiguration instead.

       This project creates a new Domain Service that consists of two
       new message types.  The first message type requests that a
       virtual I/O device or service be added to or removed from the
       domain receiving the message.  This message type also provides
       support to request the status of a particular virtual I/O
       device or service.  The second message is a response from the
       domain for a message of the first type.  It includes the result
       of the attempted operation and the current status of the target
       device.  Optionally, in response to an add or remove request, a
       human-readable string may be returned.

   4.5 Interfaces

       4.5.1 Overview

             The new interface is embodied in the format of the
             messages passed between the control domain to the guest
             or I/O domain OS.

             For a detailed description of the interface see

   4.6 Doc Impact

       None.

   4.7 Admin/Config Impact

       Current behavior:

       Adding or removing an I/O device to/from an active domain using
       the LDoms Manager CLI in the control domain currently causes a
       "delayed configuration" message to be displayed to the user.
       The actual change does not take place until the affected guest
       domain is rebooted.

       New behavior:

       The requested change will take place immediately and will not
       require a reboot of the target domain.

   4.8 HA Impact

       None.

   4.9  I18N/L10N

        Not affected.
