1.0 VIO DR Messages Specification

1.1 Overview

       The Domain Services protocol (FWARC 2006/055) provides the
       means for the LDoms Manager to communicate requests and receive
       responses from existing services which run in domains.  This
       project defines a new Domain Service to allow the LDoms Manager
       to add and remove virtual devices from domains.  On the control
       domain the ldm command line interface already accepts the
       commands required to add or remove devices to/from a guest
       domain.  Currently, however, these commands result in a delayed
       reconfiguration.  When this project is complete, those same
       commands will result in a dynamic reconfiguration instead.

       This project creates a new Domain Service that consists of two
       new message types.  The first message type requests that a
       virtual I/O device or service be added to or removed from the
       domain receiving the message.  This message type also provides
       support to request the status of a particular virtual I/O
       device or service.  The second message is a response from the
       domain for a message of the first type.  It includes the result
       of the attempted operation and the current status of the target
       device.  Optionally, in response to an add or remove request, a
       human-readable string may be returned.


1.2 Detail

    1.2.1 VIO DR Version 1.0

          The ability to add or remove virtual devices from a logical
          domain is driven from the LDoms Manager CLI through a new
          domain service called VIO DR (Virtual I/O Dynamic
          Reconfiguration).


    1.2.2 Service ID

          The following service ID will uniquely identify the domain
          service protocol used for Virtual IO DR:

          Service ID Description
          ---------- -----------

          "dr-vio"   Dynamic Reconfiguration for virtual I/O devices


     1.2.3 Request Message

           All VIO DR request messages will have the following format:

           Offset Size   Field name    Description
           ------ ----   ----------    -----------

           0      8      req_num       Request number
           8      8      dev_id        Device ID
           16     4      msg_type      Message type
           20     <var>  name          Device name


           typedef struct {
                   uint64_t   req_num;
                   uint64_t   dev_id;
                   uint32_t   msg_type;
                   char       name[];
           } dr_vio_req_t;


    1.2.3.1 Message Type

            The message type (msg_type) field will contain a value
            indicating the type of operation being requested.  The
            following constants are defined for VIO DR Domain Service
            as message type values:

            Type                   Value     ASCII   Definition
            ----                   -----     -----   ----------

            DR_VIO_CONFIGURE       0x494f43  'IOC'   Configure a new device
            DR_VIO_UNCONFIGURE     0x494f55  'IOU'   Unconfigure a device
            DR_VIO_FORCE_UNCONFIG  0x494f46  'IOF'   Forcibly unconfigure
                                                     a device
            DR_VIO_STATUS          0x494f53  'IOS'   Request the status of
                                                     a device


    1.2.3.1.1 DR_VIO_CONFIGURE request

              This command requests that a guest providing this
              service attempt to configure and bring online a virtual
              I/O device that has been dynamically added or configured
              into the logical domain.  The response to this request
              indicates success or failure for this attempt.

              Before a configure request, the selected device must be
              part of the logical domain's machine description.  No
              other assumptions may be made about the state of the
              device before a configure request.  In particular,
              attempts to configure a device already in the configured
              state must succeed.  This service supports adding new
              virtual IO devices under the channel-devices node of the
              MD, but not directly under its parent, the
              virtual-devices node.

              If the guest registers a service for notifying it of a
              Machine Description update (see FWARC 2006/055 section
              3.1), that update notification must be provided to the
              guest prior to the configure request being given.

              After a successful configure request, the device is in
              the configured state, which means that it is available
              for general use by the guest.  Further steps required to
              reach the configured state is guest operating system
              specific.


    1.2.3.1.2 DR_VIO_UNCONFIGURE request

              This command requests that a guest take offline and
              unconfigure the specified device.  The response to this
              request indicates success or failure of the request.

              Before an unconfigure request, a device must be part of
              the logical domain's machine description.  No other
              assumptions may be made about the state of the device
              before an unconfigure request.  In particular, attempts
              to unconfigure a device already in the unconfigured
              state must succeed.

              After a successful unconfigure request, the device is in
              the unconfigured state, which means that it is no longer
              available for general use by the guest operating system.
              The device is still present in the guest's Machine
              Description.  The steps required to reach the
              unconfigured state is guest operating system specific.

              If the guest provides a service for registering a
              Machine Description update (see FWARC 2006/055 section
              3.1), that update notification will be provided only
              after steps have been taken to remove the device from
              the logical domain in the hypervisor and from the
              guest's Machine Description.


    1.2.3.1.3 DR_VIO_FORCE_UNCONFIG request

              This request is equivalent to DR_VIO_UNCONFIGURE in that
              it requests that a guest take offline and unconfigure
              the specified device.  In addition however, the guest
              may choose to implement an override to conditions that
              may have caused failure for any step of a
              DR_VIO_UNCONFIGURE operation.

              The response to this request indicates success or
              failure of the request.

              If the guest provides a service for registering a
              Machine Description update (see FWARC 2006/055 section
              3.1), that update notification will be provided only
              after steps have been taken to remove the device from
              the logical domain in the hypervisor and from the
              guest's Machine Description.


    1.2.3.1.4 DR_VIO_STATUS

              This command requests the configuration status of a
              specific device.  The response to this request indicates
              the current state of the device, which can include an
              optional descriptive string.


    1.2.3.2 Request number

             The request number in the message header is a
             monotonically increasing number that uniquely identifies
             each request message.

             Responses to requests are expected to use the same
             request number so they can be paired with their original
             request.

             New requests may be issued without waiting for a response
             to a preceding request.  The underlying transport
             protocol is responsible to ensure reliable, in-order and
             unduplicated message packets.

             Requests are to be processed in the order received.

    1.2.3.3 Device Name

            This element of the request message identifies the type of
            the device which is the target of the request.

            See FWARC 2008/016 section 1.1.3. The Device Name 'name'
            field in the request message corresponds to the 'name'
            property of the Virtual device node in the Machine
            Description.  It consists of a null-terminated string.
            The maximum length of this string shall be 256 characters,
            including the terminating NULL.

    1.2.3.4 Device ID

            See FWARC 2008/016 section 1.1.3.  The Device ID 'dev_id'
            field in the request message correponds to the cfg-handle
            of the Virtual device node in the Machine Description.

    1.2.4 VIO DR response message

          The overall VIO DR protocol consists of a command sent to
          the client guest which then responds with a reply indicating
          the overall result of the request.

    1.2.4.1 VIO DR response message format

            The VIO DR response message has the following format.

            Offset Size   Field name    Description
            ------ ----   ----------    -----------

            0      8      req_num       Request number
            8      4      result        Result code
            12     4      status        Status code
            16     <var>  reason        reason string (cause of error)


            typedef struct {
                   uint64_t    req_num;
                   uint32_t    result;
                   uint32_t    status;
                   char        reason[]; /* null terminated string */
            } dr_vio_res_t;


    1.2.4.2 VIO DR Result codes

            The result field in the above message indicates the result of
            the requested operation on the specified device.

            The result codes are defined as follows:


            Name                          Value   Definition
            ----                          -----   ----------

            DR_VIO_RES_OK                  0x0     Operation succeeded
            DR_VIO_RES_FAILURE             0x1     Operation failed
            DR_VIO_RES_BLOCKED             0x2     Operation was blocked
            DR_VIO_RES_NOT_IN_MD           0x3     Device undefined in MD


            For DR_VIO_UNCONFIGURE the result code DR_VIO_RES_BLOCKED
            is equivalent to DR_VIO_RES_FAILURE except that the guest
            is indicating that the operation may succeed with a
            subsequent DR_VIO_FORCE_UNCONFIG operation.


    1.2.4.3 VIO DR status codes

            The status field in the response message indicates the
            resulting status of the specified device after the
            requested operation.  For the response message to a
            configure or unconfigure request, the result field
            indicates the outcome of the operation (see 1.2.1.2
            above).  The status field will contain one of the status
            codes below to indicate state of the device after the
            attempted operation.

            For the response message corresponding to a successful
            DR_VIO_STATUS request, the status field will contain one
            of the codes below, and the result field will contain
            DR_VIO_RES_OK.  If the DR_VIO_STATUS operation fails, the
            result field will contain DR_VIO_RES_FAILURE and the
            status field will not be meaningful.

            The status codes are defined as follows:

            Name                             Value   Definition
            ----                             -----   ----------

            DR_VIO_STAT_NOT_PRESENT          0x0     Device does not exist in MD

            DR_VIO_STAT_UNCONFIGURED         0x1     Device exists in MD, but
                                                     is not configured for use
                                                     by guest

            DR_VIO_STAT_CONFIGURED           0x2     Device is configured for use
                                                     by the guest.

            A VIO device in the DR_VIO_STAT_UNCONFIGURED state may be
            safely removed from the domain configuration. Conversely,
            a VIO device in the DR_VIO_STAT_CONFIGURED state must not
            be removed from the domain configuration as the guest may
            be accessing it.


    1.2.4.4 VIO DR 'reason' string

            The response message may optionally include a
            human-readable string so that the guest may return a
            null-terminated ASCII string containing additional
            information regarding the requested operation.  The
            maximum length of this string shall be 1024 characters
            including the terminating NULL.

            If there is no 'reason' string, this field shall contain a
            single NULL character at the start of the field.  In the
            case of a successful operation no response string will be
            returned.
