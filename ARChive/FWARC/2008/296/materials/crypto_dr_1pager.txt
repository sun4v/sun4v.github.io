2. Project Summary
   2.1. Project Description:
	This project implements a new domain service to support
	crypto Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR) for ultraSPARC-T1/T2
	based platforms.

   2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area:
	Currently crypto units can not be dynamically added/removed from
	a domain.  This is cumbersome from a usability standpoint since
	a domain needs to be shutdown, reconfigured and brought back up
	to add/remove a crypto unit. Additionally the ability to dynamically
	reconfigure is required for live migration.

   3.2. Market/Requester:
	LDOMs team
