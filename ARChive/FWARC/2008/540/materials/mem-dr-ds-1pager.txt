2. Project Summary

    2.1. Project Description:

	This project defines a Memory Dynamic Reconfiguration domain
	service required to dynamically add/remove memory to/from a
	guest.

    2.2. Risks and Assumptions:

        None.

3. Business Summary
   3.1. Problem Area

        As customers migrate from legacy SPARC systems to sun4v SPARC-CMT
        platforms, consolidation, provisioning, and dynamic load balancing
        become major business drivers.  LDoms currently has dynamic CPU
        capabilities, but no dynamic I/O or memory.  Until dynamic IO (VIO DR)
        and dynamic memory features are deployed, customers cannot exploit
        the full potential of virtualization.  This is directly impacting
        sales of SPARC-CMT today.  Further, Supernova platforms have Memory
        DR as a specific RR requirement.

   3.2. Market/Requester

	Existing SPARC market, migrating from legacy SPARC to SPARC-CMT w/
        LDoms.  Scalable Systems Group server product groups within Sun.

   3.3. Business Justification

        SPARC-CMT revenue was $285M in Q2FY08, with LDoms accounting for 
        approximately 1/5th of that.  Without full dynamic resource allocation
        (i.e. CPU/Memory/IO), Sun does not have a fully competitive product
        for consolidation and virtualization.  This will impact future sales
        of SPARC-CMT.
        
   3.4. Competitive Analysis

   3.5. Opportunity Window/Exposure

        We are already late to market.  Memory DR is needed ASAP.

    3.6. How will you know when you are done?:

	When the LDom manager is able to utilize this service to successfully
	reconfigure a guest's memory while the guest is running.

4. Technical Description:

	Memory DR for sun4v platforms is capacity-based and enables
	addition/removal of an arbitrary amount of memory to/from a
	running LDom. This is in contrast to the board-based model
	on sun4u platforms where a system board containing memory is
	added/removed to/from a running domain.

        This project creates a new Domain Service that consists of two
        new messages - a request and response message.

        The request message allows LDom manager to send a request message 
        to a domain. There are in total five unique types of request messages. 
        The first two message types allow the addition and removal of memory 
        from a domain. Since the removal of memory from a domain can be a 
        long running operation, two additional message types are provided 
        to track a removal operation and to cancel a long running memory 
        remove operation. The fifth message type is used to query the status 
        of memory in the domain.

        The response message is sent back by the domain for a request message.
        It includes the result of the attempted operation, status of a ongoing
        operation or the entire range of memory in the domain, depending on
        the request sent. Optionally, in response to a request, a human-readable
        string may also be returned in the response.

   4.5 Interfaces

       4.5.1 Overview

             The new interface is embodied in the format of the messages 
             passed between the control domain to the guest domain OS.

             For a detailed description of the interface see

   4.6 Doc Impact

       None.

   4.7 Admin/Config Impact

       Current behavior:

       Adding or removing memory to/from an active domain using
       the LDoms Manager CLI in the control domain currently causes a
       "delayed configuration" message to be displayed to the user.
       The actual change does not take place until the affected guest
       domain is rebooted.

       New behavior:

       The requested change will take place immediately and will not
       require a reboot of the target domain.

   4.8 HA Impact

       None.

   4.9  I18N/L10N

        Not affected.

   4.10 Packaging & Delivery

        This case defines a generic interface and is not tied to a particular
        architecture.

   4.11 Security Impact

        None.
