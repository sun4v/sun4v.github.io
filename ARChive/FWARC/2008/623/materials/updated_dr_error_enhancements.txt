4. Technical Description

4.1 Overview

	This project will improve the error reporting capability
	associated with dynamic reconfiguration of virtual cpus,
	(VCPUs), virtual I/O devices, and memory.  The response
	message formats of the three DR services all provide for
	passing back an error string for certain types of failure.
	For example, if attempting to remove multiple vcpus, and some
	succeed and some fail, the user will see error messages
	describing why the failed vcpus could not be removed.  On the
	other hand, if the failure was a problem related to the entire
	request, the protocol does not currently provide for passing
	back a descriptive error message.  This project will make
	small changes to the message formats (and semantics) so that
	an error string can be returned for ALL failures.

	The minor version number of the DR domain services will be
	incremented such that the version will move from 1.0 to 1.1.
	The target domain DR modules and the initiator module for DR
	requests will be modified to conform to this new version of
	the domain service.  If an initiator module using version 1.1
	is interacting with a target domain DR module also using 1.1,
	the new domain service will be utilized, and the user will see
	the improved error messages.  If either of the modules is
	running version 1.0, the peer will adjust downward, so that
	version 1.0 of the domain service will be utilized, and the
	error reporting behavior will remain at its current level.
	For a more complete description of versioning see FWARC
	2006/055 section 2.5.5 "DS Capability Version Negotiation &
	Registration".

4.5 Interfaces

        4.5.1 Interfaces

                The modified interface consists of a change to the
                format of existing message exchanged between the
                guest DR modules and the initiator module for DR
                requests.  Section 3.4.5 of FWARC/2006/055 states:

		"The message type DR_CPU_ERROR is a response to a
		malformed request message.  No additional payload is
		provided with this message type."  Similar statements
		apply to DR VIO (for the DR_VIO_RES_FAILURE result
		code) and DR Memory (for the DR_MEM_ERROR result
		code).

		This project will change the semantics of these error
		response codes (described below) as well as the
		corresponding response message as follows:

	4.5.4 DR CPU Message Format

		The interface change consists of a modification to an
		existing message format, by adding the new field 'err_msg'
		as shown below.  It modifies section FWARC 2006/055
		section 3.4.5 "CPU DR Error response".

		New payload for DR_CPU_ERROR mdsg_type:

		Offset Size             Field Name     Description
		------ ----             ----------     -----------

		0      <variable>       err_msg        null-terminated string

		The maximum length of the err_msg field including the
		terminal null shall be 1024 characters.  The error
		message will indicate the nature of the failure, such
		as badly formatted request, intra-guest communication
		failure, etc.

		Note: the new err_msg field of the response message
		payload applies only to response messages, and then
		only when the 'msg_type' element of the header is
		DR_CPU_ERROR.

	4.5.5 DR VIO Message Format (unchanged)

		The interface change does not involve any change to
		the format of the response message.

		The result codes also remain unchanged.  The DR VIO
		case (FWARC 2008/299) already provides for passing
		an error message on failures.


	4.5.6 DR Memory Message Format

		The interface change consists of a modification to an
		existing message format, by adding the new field 'err_msg'
		as shown below.  It modifies section FWARC 2008/540
		section 1.5 "DR_MEM_ERROR response".

		New payload for DR_MEM_ERROR:

		Offset Size   Field Name    Description
		------ ----   ----------    -----------

		0      <var>  err_msg       Error msg (null-terminated string)

		The maximum length of the err_msg field including the
		terminal null shall be 1024 characters.  The error
		message will indicate the nature of the failure, such
		as badly formatted request, intra-guest communication
		failure, etc.

		Note: the new err_msg field of the response message
		payload applies only to response messages, and then
		only when the 'msg_type' element of the header is
		DR_MEM_ERROR.
