2. Project Summary

2.1 Project Description

	Enhance the LDoms DR Domain Services to provide better
	error reporting to the user for certain types of failure
	for which no explanation is currently given.  The error
	messages must describe the cause of the failure in the
	target domain.

2.2 Risks and Assumptions

        None.

3. Business Summary

3.1 Problem Area

	There are currently three Domain Services for Dynamic
	Reconfiguration of an LDoms domain: DR CPU, DR VIO and DR
	Memory.  (See reference below.) These services allow
	management software to make dynamic configuration changes to a
	target domain.  The existing version of these domain services
	provides for passing an error string back from the guest for
	certain types of failure.

	For other types of failure, such as problems interacting with
	other software components in the target domain, a generic
	message is displayed to the user.  This message does not aid
	the user in diagnosing the cause of the problem so that
	attempts can be made to rectify it.

	Example: if the guest domain that is the target of an 'ldm
	rm-vcpu' request is running Solaris, and is not running the
	reconfiguration daemon (drd), the request will be rejected.
	The user will see this message in response to the ' 'ldm
	rm-vcpu' command:

		Unable to remove the requested VCPU(s) from LDom ldg1
		Resource removal failed

	Using the current version of the domain service is inadequate,
	and the target domain cannot send as part of its error
	response the reason for the failure.  It would be much more
	helpful to the user to see a descriptive message like this:

		Cannot communicate with reconfiguration daemon (drd) in
		target domain.  drd(1M) SMF service may not be enabled.


3.2 Market/Requestor

        See FWARC/2005/633

3.3 Business Justification

        See FWARC/2005/633

3.4 Competitive Analysis

	This is a usability issue which needs to be rectified in order
	for LDoms to be seen as a competitive virtualization solution.

3.5 Opportunity Window/Exposure

        See FWARC/2005/663.

3.6 How will you know when you are done?

        The work will be completed when the final code changes to
        implement a new version (1.1) of the three DR Domain Services
        are integrated into the Solaris NV and Solaris 10 Update gates
        and the LDoms Manager gate.

4. Technical Description

4.1 Overview

	This project will improve the error reporting capability
	associated with dynamic reconfiguration of virtual cpus,
	(VCPUs), virtual I/O devices, and memory.  The response
	message formats of the three DR services all provide for
	passing back an error string for certain types of failure.
	For example, if attempting to remove multiple vcpus, and some
	succeed and some fail, the user will see error messages
	describing why the failed vcpus could not be removed.  On the
	other hand, if the failure was a problem related to the entire
	request, the protocol does not currently provide for passing
	back a descriptive error message.  This project will make
	small changes to the message formats (and semantics) so that
	an error string can be returned for ALL failures.

	The minor version number of the DR domain services will be
	incremented such that the version will move from 1.0 to 1.1.
	The target domain DR modules and the initiator module for DR
	requests will be modified to conform to this new version of
	the domain service.  If an initiator module using version 1.1
	is interacting with a target domain DR module also using 1.1,
	the new domain service will be utilized, and the user will see
	the improved error messages.  If either of the modules is
	running version 1.0, the peer will adjust downward, so that
	version 1.0 of the domain service will be utilized, and the
	error reporting behavior will remain at its current level.
	For a more complete description of versioning see FWARC
	2006/055 section 2.5.5 "DS Capability Version Negotiation &
	Registration".

4.2 Bug/RFE Number(s)

	6719903 DR error message should be more helpful when 'drd' is disabled

4.3 Scope

4.4 Out of Scope

        Not Applicable.

4.5 Interfaces

        4.5.1 Interfaces

                The modified interface consists of a change to the
                format of existing message exchanged between the
                guest DR modules and the initiator module for DR
                requests.  Section 3.4.5 of FWARC/2006/055 states:

		"The message type DR_CPU_ERROR is a response to a
		malformed request message.  No additional payload is
		provided with this message type."  Similar statements
		apply to DR VIO (for the DR_VIO_RES_FAILURE result
		code) and DR Memory (for the DR_MEM_ERROR result
		code).

		This project will change the semantics of these error
		response codes (described below) as well as the
		corresponding response message as follows:

	4.5.4 DR CPU Message Format

		The interface change consists of a modification to an
		existing message format, by adding the new field 'err_msg'
		as shown below.  It modifies section FWARC 2006/055
		section 3.4.5 "CPU DR Error response"

		Common message header (unchanged)

		Offset Size   Field Name    Description
		------ ----   ----------    -----------

		0      8      req_num       Request number
		8      4      msg_type      Message type
                12     4      num_records   Number of records

		Payload (immediately following above header)

		Offset Size             Field Name     Description
		------ ----             ----------     -----------

		16     4*num_records	req_cpus       array of vcpu ids
                                                       (applies to requests)
		16     16*num_records   resp_cpu_stats array of status structs
                                                       (applies to responses)
		16     <variable>       err_msg        null-terminated string
                                                       (applies to responses)

		Note: the new err_msg field of the response message
		payload applies only to response messages, and then
		only when the 'msg_type' element of the header is
		DR_CPU_ERROR.

	4.5.5 DR VIO Message Format (unchanged)

		The interface change does not involve any change to
		the format of the response message.

		The result codes also remain unchanged.  The DR VIO
		case (FWARC 2008/299) already provides for passing
		an error message on failures.


	4.5.6 DR Memory Message Format

	The interface change consists of a modification to an existing
	message format, by adding a payload field for the case when
	the 'msg_type' of the response header is DR_MEM_ERROR.  It
	modifies FWARC 2008/540 section 1.5 of the messages document.

		Message header (unchanged):

		Offset Size   Field Name    Description
		------ ----   ----------    -----------

		0      4      msg_type      Message type
		4      4      msg_arg       Message argument
		8      8      req_num       Request number

		Payload field (new) immediately following the header:

		Offset Size   Field Name    Description
		------ ----   ----------    -----------

		16     <var>  err_msg       Error msg (null-terminated string)

		The maximum length of the err_msg field including the
		terminal null shall be 1024 characters.  The error
		message will indicate the nature of the failure, such
		as badly formatted request, intra-guest communication
		failure, etc.
